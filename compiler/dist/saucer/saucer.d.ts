/**
 * LOOP IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * Loops compile to this bytecode structure:
 *
 * CONDITIONAL LOOP (while/for with condition):
 *   [IF][backCount][condition]     ← skip entire loop if condition false
 *   [body...]                      ← loop body with break/continue as JUMP_2 placeholders
 *   [update...]                    ← for-loop update (i++)
 *   [IF][skipBottom][condition]    ← re-check condition
 *   [JUMP_BACK][count]             ← jump back to top if condition true
 *                                  ← loop exit (break lands here)
 *
 * INFINITE LOOP (while(true) or for(;;)):
 *   [body...]                      ← loop body
 *   [update...]                    ← update expression
 *   [JUMP_BACK][count]             ← always jump back
 *                                  ← break lands here
 *
 * BREAK/CONTINUE:
 *   Both emit [JUMP_2][0][0] placeholders. The 2-byte target is recorded in JumpOffsets.
 *   When the loop is assembled, patchBody() fills in the actual jump distances:
 *   - break: jumps forward past JUMP_BACK (exits loop)
 *   - continue: jumps forward to update section, then condition re-check loops back
