/**
 * SVM target profile — the single reference for how the 'svm' target differs
 * from the EVM v12 dialect. The SVM engine executes the SAME v12 postfix opcode
 * table; only these ops diverge:
 *
 * UNSUPPORTED (engine raises UnsupportedOpcode; the compiler rejects them at
 * emission — see SVM_UNSUPPORTED below): the CREATE family and DELEGATE.
 *
 * DIVERGENT SHAPE (same opcode byte, different operands — lowered differently
 * by V12Saucer when ctx.isSvm):
 *   - CALL (0xA2):   pops [target(top, 32-byte program id), calldata (Bytes
 *     descriptor), accounts (static ARRAY of scalar account indices, element
 *     data inline in bytecode)]. NO value operand. Indices are 0-based into the
 *     execute instruction's USER account slice (after the 3 engine PDAs).
 *     Per-CPI account cap: 64.
 *   - STATIC (0xA3): alias of CALL — identical operands.
 *   - SLOAD (0x81):  pops [account_index(top), offset, len] → pushes a Bytes
 *     descriptor over that slice of the account's data (surface: accountData).
 *   - SSTORE (0xC5): pops [account_index(top), offset, value descriptor] →
 *     writes the bytes into the account's data (surface: writeAccountData).
 *
 * DIVERGENT LOWERING (same SauceScript source, different opcode byte):
 *   - uint(data): lowers to the platform-native cast — CAST_BE (0x54) on 'v12',
 *     CAST_LE (0x55) on 'svm'. The endianness rule lives on the builtin in
 *     globals.ts.
 *
 * Everything else passes through untouched — the engine has fork-parity analogs
 * for all chain ops (MSG_SENDER, TIMESTAMP, BALANCE, CHAIN_ID, LOG, KECCAK,
 * ABI codec, EVAL, CATCH, TLOAD/TSTORE, ...). Note: EVAL runs in static mode
 * (no CPI inside eval'd code), and CATCH intercepts only PRE-FLIGHT CPI
 * failures — once invoke() launches, a failing callee aborts the transaction.
