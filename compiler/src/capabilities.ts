/**
 * Per-target capability gate — the single, central, BIDIRECTIONAL classification of which
 * language features/opcodes/call-shapes are restricted to a subset of the three compile
 * targets ('v1' | 'v12' | 'svm'). This is what lets a "universal" source file (an evm/svm
 * arm pair, or one file relying on the fold/`defines`/treeshake machinery to drop the
 * unreachable arm) compile per target instead of per-branch: an EVM-only feature is allowed
 * on v1/v12 and rejected on svm; an svm-only feature is allowed on svm and rejected on
 * v1/v12; a v12-DIALECT feature (allowed on v12+svm, rejected on v1) is a third axis, which
 * is why each row carries an explicit `targets` SET rather than an evm/svm boolean.
 *
 * NOT a pre-codegen IR pass. This compiler has no IR to hang one on — `compile()` (index.ts)
 * goes acorn AST -> processor walk -> Saucer/V12Saucer builders that append bytes as the walk
 * proceeds. A separate pre-codegen scan would have to re-derive every contract-binding/global
 * resolution rule the real walk already owns (see expression.ts's four binding shapes,
 * globals.ts's GLOBALS dispatch, inline.ts's splicing) — exactly the class of duplicate-walk
 * bug this repo has already paid for once (return-kind.ts's `matchStandaloneBindingShape`
 * clone of `resolveStandaloneBinding`, and its own follow-up staleness fix). Worse, a
 * pre-pass would see code the fold pass / `defines` / treeshake will delete before it ever
 * reaches codegen, and would wrongly reject an EVM-only feature sitting in an already-dead
 * svm-only arm. So the gate is a small helper called AT the existing emit sites — it fires
 * only for code that actually reaches codegen, which is the precise semantics a per-target
 * library needs.
 *
 * NOT gated, deliberately (verified by compiling each on target 'svm' — see
 * test/target-capabilities.test.ts's over-gating guard): abi.encode/decode (the ABI CODEC
 * itself is universal — only the ABI-*typed-binding* surface below is EVM-only), emit/LOG,
 * crypto.*, msg.*, block.*, tx.*, address.*, gasLeft/blockHash/blobHash, storage.tRead/tWrite
 * (transient storage — a divergent-lowering, fork-parity op, not a gated one), eval, Math.*,
 * Uint8Array.from. A future edit MUST NOT "complete" this table with any of those.
