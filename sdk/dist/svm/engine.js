/**
 * SVM engine wire constants.
 *
 * The wire-contract values (discriminators, header offsets/sizes, payload flags,
 * seed scheme) are NOT hand-copied here anymore — they are re-exported from
 * `engine-abi.generated.ts`, which `sdk/scripts/gen-engine-abi.mjs` derives from
 * the pinned `sauce` dep's `svm/abi/engine-abi.json`. That artifact is generated
 * from the engine's live Rust constants and CI-asserted byte-equal to them
 * (engine `tests/abi_artifact.rs`). CI regenerates the module and `git diff`s it,
 * and `engine-abi-drift.test.ts` asserts every artifact key is mapped — so a repin
 * that changes the wire can't silently leave this file stale.
 *
 * This closes the drift that motivated the whole exercise: the SDK once carried
 * `BYTECODE_FORMAT_EPOCH = 2` while the engine's value was 4, then the field was
 * deleted entirely — two repos, one constant, three values, and no test could see
 * it. That constant (and `BUFFER_VERSION`, and the index/epoch header fields) are
 * gone from the engine, not merely renumbered: the engine deploys **non-upgradeable**
 * (`--final`), so one program id has exactly one ISA and one header layout forever.
 * A format change ships as a NEW program id, and buffer PDAs are derived under a
 * program id — a buffer written under the old format isn't even addressable from
 * the new program. So a client-side version/epoch check compared a constant
 * against itself; there was never a value a reader could act on. `kind` (byte 0)
 * is now the whole account discriminant. Do NOT reintroduce a version/epoch field
 * "for safety" — it would be a fabricated guarantee against a value the engine no
 * longer publishes.
 *
 * Only the constants NOT expressible in the ABI live here directly: BPF heap-frame
 * sizing, packet budgets, the staging chunk, CU limits, and the synthetic chain
 * ids — all SDK/transaction-shape concerns, not engine wire values.
