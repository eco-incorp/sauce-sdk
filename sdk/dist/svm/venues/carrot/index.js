/**
 * Carrot Protocol vault ladder — a NAV-priced, multi-asset stablecoin vault
 * (issue/redeem against a shared basket), NOT a 2-mint AMM pool. One
 * singleton on-chain `Vault` account (`FfCRL34rkJiMiX5emNDrYp3MdWH2mES3FvDQyFppqgpJ`,
 * a PDA of `["vault", CRT_MINT]` under `CARROT_PROGRAM_ID`) currently holds
 * three basket assets (USDC/USDT/pyUSD) and issues/redeems a single share
 * token (CRT, Token-2022). This adapter serves SIX directed pairs off that
 * one account — `issue:<assetId>` (asset -> CRT) and `redeem:<assetId>`
 * (CRT -> asset) for each basket asset — via `carrotAllDirections` (see
 * `the consuming app SVM solver entry`'s FAMILIES dispatch generalization it requires).
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH: no official IDL/program source is public. Layout, instruction
 * discriminators, and the account list are taken from the reverse-engineered
 * `carrot-sdk` crate (github.com/hogyzen12/carrot-sdk, MIT, matches an
 * observed 4,872-byte Anchor IDL blob) and INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED against
 * the real deployed program:
 *   - the byte layout below was decoded against the REAL vault account
 *     (`FfCRL34rkJiMiX5emNDrYp3MdWH2mES3FvDQyFppqgpJ`, 852 bytes, 3 assets,
 *     22+ strategies) and cross-checked field-by-field against the crate's
 *     `Vault`/`Fee`/`Asset`/`StrategyRecord` Borsh structs;
 *   - the `issue`/`redeem` account list and instruction discriminators were
 *     PROVEN via six real `simulateTransaction` dry-runs (sigVerify:false,
 *     no funds moved, an existing funded mainnet wallet's own ATAs as
 *     depositor/dest) against the live program — three ISSUE sizes
 *     (0.1/1/4 USDC -> 1,735,398 / 17,353,982 / 69,415,929 CRT-raw, matching
 *     this ladder's own formula to ~0.04%, fully attributable to ordinary
 *     mainnet state drift between the off-chain snapshot and the later
 *     simulateTransaction call — see "VALIDATION" below) and three REDEEM
 *     sizes (100/200/486 CRT-raw -> 5/11/27 USDC-raw, bit-exact at this dust
 *     scale). The real CPI needs ~232,244 CU (see `../budget.ts`'s
 *     `CU_FAMILIES.carrot`) — the framework's default 200,000 CU budget is
 *     NOT enough; every issue/redeem needs an explicit ComputeBudget bump.
 *
 * NAV FORMULA (the "single-asset path" this integration ships): the real
 * `issue`/`redeem` account list carries, per basket asset, ONLY `[vaultAta,
 * oracle]` as remaining accounts — NO strategy account ever rides the
 * instruction (confirmed both by the crate's `Vault::get_remaining_accounts`
 * source AND by the six real dry-runs above succeeding with exactly that
 * account set). This means the on-chain program cannot read a strategy's
 * LIVE external-protocol position during a swap at all — it can only value
 * each basket asset from what the instruction actually attaches: that
 * asset's own vault-held ATA balance and its oracle price. The vault's own
 * cached `StrategyRecord.balance` ledger (deployed-to-marginfi/klend/solend/
 * mango/drift positions) is therefore NOT part of the on-chain NAV this
 * swap computes — confirmed numerically: modeling NAV as
 * Σ(vaultAta·price) alone reproduces the six measured dry-runs to ~0.04%
 * (ordinary same-second price/state drift); including the cached strategy
 * balances in NAV is off by ~0.33%, an order of magnitude worse and NOT
 * explained by drift. So: **no marginfi/klend/solend/mango/drift adaptor is
 * needed at all for this swap path** — the plan text's premise that one is
 * required doesn't hold once you look at what accounts the real CPI
 * actually reads. This corrects, rather than follows, that premise.
 *   NAV_common = Σ_assets  ataBalance_i · oraclePrice_i · scale_i
 *   issue:  sharesOut = floor(x · price_t · scale_t · supply / NAV_common)
 *   redeem: grossCommon = floor(x · NAV_common / supply)
 *           grossOut    = floor(grossCommon / (price_t · scale_t))
 *           netOut      = grossOut − floor(grossOut · redemptionFeeBps / 10000)
 *           netOut      = min(netOut, ataBalance_t)   — SATURATING capacity
 *             clamp (see "CAPACITY" below), never a cliff to zero.
 * `scale_i = 10^(CARROT_TARGET_SCALE + oracleExponent_i − decimals_i)` is a
 * per-asset, fetch-time-baked (never live-computed on-chain — SauceScript has
 * no exponentiation intrinsic) integer factor that puts every asset's
 * ata·price term on one common denomination before summing; it is 10,000 for
 * all three known assets today (decimals=6, oracle exponent=−8 uniformly),
 * derived generically (not hardcoded to 6/−8) so a future basket asset with
 * different decimals/exponent needs no code change. All arithmetic is plain
 * BigInt multiply/floor-divide — the intermediate products here (at most
 * ~1e13 balance × ~1e8 price × 1e4 scale ≈ 1e25 per term) stay far under a
 * u256 word, so no `Math.mulDiv` wide-multiply is needed (see obric-v2's
 * ladder for the same plain-arithmetic convention with oracle-scaled terms).
 *
 * CAPACITY: `issue` is genuinely unbounded pool-side (any deposit mints
 * proportional shares, matching sanctum-stake-pool's "no curvature to
 * misrepresent" reasoning) — `defaultRungs` would lose nothing at 2, but
 * this family is pinned at the framework's CP default (4, via
 * `CU_FAMILIES.carrot.kind = 'cp'`) because `redeem` is NOT unbounded: its
 * payout is a plain SPL transfer out of `vaultAta_t`, so redeeming more
 * shares than that asset's live vault balance covers would REVERT the real
 * CPI atomically (and a launched CPI failure aborts the whole SVM cook — no
 * execution-time catch). `netOut = min(computed, ataBalance_t)` SATURATES
 * the curve instead of collapsing it — monotone non-decreasing, flat past
 * capacity — exactly the shape the merge needs to keep this venue
 * electable near its cap rather than allocating it zero (see
 * `docs`/CLAUDE.md's "a coarse or non-monotone ladder gets allocated ZERO"
 * note); the extra rungs (vs. issue's 2 would suffice) buy the merge enough
 * resolution to see the kink.
 *
 * SELF-DROP SCOPE: the plan text anticipated self-dropping "when an asset's
 * strategy account is unreadable" — but per the NAV formula above, no
 * strategy account is ever read, so that specific failure mode cannot arise.
 * The analogous, CORRECTLY-SCOPED self-drop this adapter implements is: the
 * WHOLE vault self-drops (fetchPoolConfig throws, caught by
 * `resolveSvmPoolSpec`) if the vault is paused, holds more than
 * `CARROT_MAX_ASSETS` basket assets (a fail-loud cap, not a silent
 * truncation — see that constant), or if ANY basket asset's mint/ata/oracle
 * account is missing or fails its shape gate — because NAV_common is a JOINT
 * sum over every basket asset, one bad asset makes every direction's quote
 * wrong, not just that asset's own. `entry.gate` additionally self-drops the
 * SPECIFIC direction being resolved if its own oracle reading is stale
 * (`now − publishTime` beyond `MAX_ORACLE_STALENESS_SECONDS`) — a per-
 * direction, not whole-vault, condition.
 *
 * TOKEN PROGRAM: CRT and pyUSD are Token-2022; USDC/USDT are classic
 * Tokenkeg — this mirrors the reference SDK's OWN hardcoded
 * `get_token_program_id` (there is no way to derive "which token program"
 * from mint account BYTES alone: a Token-2022 mint with zero extensions is
 * byte-identical in its first 82 bytes to a classic mint, and the shared
 * `AccountLoader` interface exposes bytes only, never the account's owner
 * metadata) — `CARROT_TOKEN_2022_MINTS` names the known set explicitly.
 *
 * DISCOVERY: this is a SINGLETON (one vault, ever) with a basket, not a
 * "many pools, one 2-mint pair each" family — it does not fit
 * `SVM_FAMILY_FILTERS`' generic getProgramAccounts memcmp shape (there is
 * nothing to scan for, and the second mint of any pair lives at a
 * per-asset-index offset inside a Vec, not one fixed offset). It is wired as
 * a bespoke, zero-RPC candidate emission in `the consuming app SVM discovery module`
 * instead — see that file's `carrotCandidatesFor`.
