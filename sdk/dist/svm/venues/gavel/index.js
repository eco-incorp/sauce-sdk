/**
 * Gavel / "Plasma" (Ellipsis Labs sr-AMM, program `srAMMzfVHVAtgSJc8iH6CfKzuWuUTzLHVCE81QU1rgi`) —
 * a sandwich-resistant constant-product AMM. This is NOT a CLOB: the whole
 * pool state (a fixed-size `PoolAccount`, no dynamic order book) fits one
 * account, so the quote is fully closed-form and needs no off-chain-shipped
 * window/levels at all.
 *
 * SOURCE: the program is OPEN-SOURCE, BUSL-1.1-licensed
 * (github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/plasma, verified build deployed at the program id
 * above per Ellipsis Labs' own "Introducing Gavel"/"Introducing Plasma" posts
 * and the Helius "Solana's Proprietary AMM Revolution" writeup) — every
 * offset and formula below is TRANSCRIBED from `crates/plasma_state/src/
 * {accounts,amm}.rs`, not reverse-engineered, and cross-verified against a
 * REAL mainnet pool (`CcWf5D6BhUTv2tD4ebFFcmCdTUgBWMc8CqqoJvFHGGXi`, the
 * IBRL/wSOL launch pool referenced in Ellipsis Labs' own "IBRL" test-coin
 * writeup): the discriminator decoded to the pinned constant below,
 * base/quote decimals (6/9) and mints matched the real IBRL/wSOL pair, and
 * quotes at 4 sizes each way matched the REAL `plasma-amm-state` crate's own
 * `Amm::simulate_{buy,sell}_exact_in` bit-for-bit (built from the cloned repo
 * via `cargo build`, fed the live dumped account bytes — see the "sr-AMM
 * healing" section below for why this crate-level check, not a
 * `simulateTransaction`, is the strongest available verification: the crate
 * needs no trader/vault accounts to exercise, and it IS the real program's
 * logic, not a re-implementation of it).
 *
 * ── Account layout (`PoolHeader` + `Amm`, `#[repr(C)]` + `bytemuck::Pod`,
 *    cast directly from account bytes at offset 0 — `initialize.rs`'s
 *    `try_from_bytes_mut::<PoolAccount>(&mut pool_bytes)`, no prefix) ──
 *
 * `PoolHeader`: discriminator([u8;8])@0, sequence_number(u64)@8,
 * base_params(TokenParams)@16, quote_params(TokenParams)@88,
 * fee_recipients(ProtocolFeeRecipients, 264 bytes)@160,
 * swap_sequence_number(u64)@424, padding@432 — 528 bytes total.
 * `TokenParams` (72 bytes): decimals(u32)@0, vault_bump(u32)@4,
 * mint_key(Pubkey)@8, vault_key(Pubkey)@40.
 * `Amm` starts at 528 (528 % 16 == 0, so this holds regardless of the
 * platform alignment of the `I80F48`/`i128` `reward_factor` field):
 * fee_in_bps(u32)@528, protocol_allocation_in_pct(u32)@532,
 * lp_vesting_window(u64)@536, reward_factor(i128)@544, total_lp_shares(u64)@560,
 * slot_snapshot(u64)@568, base_reserves_snapshot(u64)@576,
 * quote_reserves_snapshot(u64)@584, base_reserves(u64)@592,
 * quote_reserves(u64)@600, cumulative_quote_lp_fees(u64)@608,
 * cumulative_quote_protocol_fees(u64)@616 — 624 bytes total (GAVEL_POOL_SIZE).
 * All offsets confirmed by decoding 112 real mainnet pools via
 * getProgramAccounts (memcmp on the discriminant + dataSize 624) and finding
 * sane fee_in_bps (25/30 bps)/reserves/decimals at every one.
 *
 * fee_in_bps is IMMUTABLE post-init (no admin instruction in
 * `PlasmaInstruction` mutates it — only `WithdrawProtocolFees`, a payout, and
 * `WithdrawLpFees`), so it is baked as a compile-time PARAM (like fluxbeam's
 * trade-fee numerators) rather than re-read live each trade.
 *
 * ── sr-AMM "healing" — a virtual, ONE-LEVEL limit order at the window's
 *    anchor price (amm.rs `get_limit_order_size_in_base_and_quote` +
 *    `buy_exact_in`/`sell_exact_in`) ──
 *
 * Every `Swap` instruction first calls (processor/swap.rs)
 * `let slot = Clock::get()?.slot; let snapshot_slot = (slot / LEADER_SLOT_WINDOW) * LEADER_SLOT_WINDOW;`
 * (`LEADER_SLOT_WINDOW = 4`, lib.rs) then `Amm::maybe_update_snapshot(snapshot_slot)`:
 * if `snapshot_slot > self.slot_snapshot` (a NEW 4-slot leader window since
 * this pool was last touched), the snapshot RESETS to the pool's own CURRENT
 * reserves (so the virtual level's size — see below — collapses to exactly
 * 0, a pure constant-product swap); otherwise (this pool already traded
 * within the SAME window) the STORED snapshot stays in force.
 *
 * When the stored snapshot differs from current reserves, one side carries a
 * virtual limit order priced EXACTLY at the snapshot's price ratio, sized so
 * consuming it exactly restores that ratio (the closed-form in
 * `get_limit_order_size_in_base_and_quote`'s doc comment). CRITICALLY — and
 * this inverts the naive intuition — the side that gets a virtual level is
 * whichever one trades AGAINST the direction the price has ALREADY moved
 * this window (a buyer gets an ask only when price has already DROPPED
 * — `quote_snapshot*base_reserves > base_snapshot*quote_reserves`, i.e.
 * snapshot price > current price — and it fills at that HIGHER, WORSE-for-
 * the-buyer snapshot price; symmetrically a seller's bid only appears when
 * price has RISEN and fills at the LOWER, WORSE-for-the-seller snapshot
 * price). This is NOT a "the taker always benefits" mechanism: it is a
 * "trade back toward the window's anchor price regardless of who benefits"
 * mechanism, and its actual anti-sandwich effect is neutralizing a would-be
 * attacker's BACK-RUN leg (which sells back into a price the attacker's own
 * front-run inflated) — see the module-level measured example below.
 * PROVEN, not assumed: an EARLIER analysis in this exact investigation
 * assumed the opposite sign (that ignoring the level is a strictly
 * CONSERVATIVE approximation) and was REFUTED by a controlled scenario
 * before it shipped — a same-window SELL then BUY (or BUY then SELL)
 * measured the real crate returning STRICTLY LESS than a plain
 * current-reserves constant-product quote for the same input (e.g. a
 * same-window sell of 30_000_000_000 lowering price, then a 2_000_000_000
 * buy: real crate 174,752,288,804 base out vs 175,499,103,175 if the level
 * were ignored) — so a "just use current reserves" shortcut would be a
 * FAVORABLE ERROR (over-promising), exactly the class of bug this repo's
 * integration policy calls a liveness hazard. This module therefore
 * implements the FULL two-piece close (virtual level + constant-product
 * tail), not an approximation, and both branches are validated bit-for-bit
 * against the real `plasma-amm-state` crate (see the module doc above and
 * `test/svm/venues/gavel.test.ts`).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS COMPUTABLE ON-CHAIN WITHOUT A SHIPPED WINDOW (unlike
 * manifest/phoenix's order books): `slot_snapshot` / `*_reserves_snapshot` /
 * `base_reserves` / `quote_reserves` are all FIXED-OFFSET fields on the ONE
 * pool account already being read — no tree walk. The one missing datum
 * (`Clock::get()?.slot`, the LIVE current slot) is read via SauceScript's
 * `block.number`, which the SVM engine profile documents as having a
 * fork-parity analog for every EVM chain op (compiler/dist/saucer/
 * svm-profile.js) — EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED here (not merely trusted from that
 * comment) by compiling `function main(){ return abi.encode(block.number,
 * block.timestamp) }` for target 'svm' and executing it on the real engine.so
 * inside a LiteSVM harness pinned via `svm.warpToSlot(1000)` +
 * `svm.setClock(new Clock(1000, 0n, 0n, 0n, 12345n))`: it returned
 * `(1000, 12345)` — `block.number` is exactly the Solana slot, `block.timestamp`
 * exactly the Clock's unix_timestamp, independently steerable (the SAME
 * mechanism `solfi-v2` already established for its own live-slot read — see
 * `the consuming app cu e2e test`'s `SOLFI_SLOT` comment). So `referenceQuote`'s
 * `now` parameter, for THIS family, is the CURRENT SLOT (not a unix
 * timestamp) — the same convention solfi-v2 set; `now` absent defaults to 0n
 * (same as solfi-v2), which — since a real `slot_snapshot` is always > 0
 * once a pool has ever swapped — takes the "trust the stored snapshot"
 * branch, never the reset.
 *
 * ── Swap CPI (`PlasmaInstruction::Swap` = 0, instruction.rs) ──
 *
 * Accounts (shank-declared): [0] `plasma_program` (this program's own id,
 * readonly — self-CPI for event logging, the same idiom manifest/phoenix
 * use), [1] `log_authority` (readonly PDA seeds=[b"log"], hardcoded in
 * lib.rs as `37zgQb6PjFuxah6R8CTk67gEvLrpqPQ61E7vh9ARPGFD` and asserted there
 * by a `check_pda` test), [2] `pool` (writable), [3] `trader` (signer, NOT
 * writable), [4] `base_account` (trader's, writable), [5] `quote_account`
 * (trader's, writable), [6] `base_vault` (writable), [7] `quote_vault`
 * (writable), [8] `token_program`. `token_program` is HARDCODED to
 * `spl_token::id()` in every account loader in this program
 * (validation/loaders.rs) — classic-Tokenkeg only, no Token-2022 path exists,
 * so (unlike fluxbeam) mints are gated to exactly 82 bytes with no
 * SOUND-vs-heuristic ambiguity.
 *
 * Data: ONE leading instruction-selector byte (`PlasmaInstruction::Swap as
 * u8` = 0 — easy to miss since `Swap`'s own variant tag is ALSO 0, but it is
 * a separate byte the entrypoint's dispatch consumes before `SwapParams` is
 * even parsed; a real-CPI run without it dispatched into `AddLiquidity`,
 * `PlasmaInstruction::to_vec`'s `vec![*self as u8]` confirms the shape) then
 * Borsh `SwapParams { side: Side, swap_type: SwapType }` — `Side` is a unit
 * enum (`Buy=0, Sell=1` by declaration order in amm.rs), `SwapType` an enum
 * whose `ExactIn{amount_in: u64, min_amount_out: u64}` variant is tag 0
 * (declaration order in processor/swap.rs). Full wire: `[ix tag=0 (Swap)]
 * [side u8][swap_type tag=0 u8][amount_in u64 LE (patched)][min_amount_out
 * u64 LE = 1]` — venue-level min_out is 1, the recipe's own terminal outAta
 * delta check is the real floor (the solswap/manifest/phoenix discipline).
 * PROVEN against the real dumped mainnet binary, not just this transcription
 * — see `the consuming app realcpi e2e test`'s `gavel` quadrilateral.
