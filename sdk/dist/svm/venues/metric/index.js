/**
 * Metric venue adapter (program `Bvs46DPFxiFE6YHxLDLD6QAUcmy51FyRVPZJusPxLk3j`) — a closed-source,
 * oracle-priced PMM. No IDL, no docs: the account layout below was recovered by scanning the
 * deployed program's own accounts (`getProgramAccounts`) and cross-referencing a real landed swap's
 * account list; the price mechanism was recovered by isolating the swap's own internal CPI.
 *
 * PRICE MECHANISM (the thing that makes this venue different from every other prop-AMM already in
 * this tree): Metric's swap does NOT price itself from a plaintext account field. Mid-swap it CPIs
 * a SEPARATE oracle program (`CvGnk4HouriGypBTZhYc76esyN5kWBepWueYVeSpR1L1`) with instruction data
 * `[0x02, feedIndex]` and gets back 32 bytes of RETURN DATA: two u128 LE Q64.64 fixed-point prices
 * (bid, then ask), quote-per-base. `feedIndex` (the oracle config account's own byte at +135) was
 * checked across 8 candidate values (0/1/10/17/18/19/20/21) — all return the IDENTICAL 32 bytes, so
 * it is a single-feed account and the byte is not load-bearing; any value works.
 *
 * A standalone, single-instruction `simulateTransaction` (sigVerify:false) that calls ONLY the
 * oracle program directly (no Metric CPI wrapper needed to observe the price) reproduces this
 * exactly: 3,398 CU, and — on the live USDC/USDT pool this adapter was ground-truthed against —
 * decoded bid/ask sat at approximately 1.00078 / 1.00079 (a ~1bp spread), consistent with a
 * cross-checked venue on the same pair the same minute.
 *
 * THE ORACLE RETURN DATA CANNOT BE REPRODUCED FROM PLAIN ACCOUNT BYTES (unlike zerofi's IEEE-754
 * oracle, or obric-v2's plaintext level): a byte-for-byte scan of the price account's own 849 bytes
 * for the measured bid/ask u128 values found no match at any offset. The oracle's internal price
 * transform is closed and unrecovered. This has one real consequence for this adapter's shape,
 * unlike every OTHER adapter in this tree: `fetchPoolConfig` cannot derive the price from
 * `AccountLoader` byte reads alone — decoding it requires actually EXECUTING the oracle's own CPI
 * (a capability `AccountLoader`, a plain byte-getter, does not have). `fetchPoolConfig` therefore
 * takes an explicit, OPTIONAL, but REQUIRED-IN-PRACTICE `fetchOracleQuote` callback: a
 * caller-supplied function that runs the oracle CPI (via `simulateTransaction` against a real RPC,
 * or a LiteSVM execution in a test) and returns its raw 32-byte return data. This keeps
 * `fetchPoolConfig` itself free of any RPC/simulate dependency (it still only calls `load`), while
 * making the one genuinely-CPI-only value an explicit, typed, refuse-don't-guess input rather than
 * a silently-wrong byte-scan guess. Missing `fetchOracleQuote` throws, naming the gate — the same
 * "refuse, don't guess" posture zerofi's fee catalog and authority table already use.
 *
 * The baked (bid, ask) become part of `MetricPoolConfig` (`paramsFor`-visible, per the
 * `SvmVenueLadder` contract) and are what the emitted fragment's quote math uses. The emitted
 * fragment issues NO on-chain oracle CPI — it multiplies by the baked scale and caps at a reserve
 * fraction (see ladder.ts). That is deliberate and load-bearing: the oracle program CAN revert
 * post-invoke() (measured live, not hypothetical — program error Custom:20 when its price account
 * is stale), and SVM's CATCH is PRE-FLIGHT-ONLY, so an in-quote CPI revert would abort the WHOLE
 * cook — every co-merged venue's fill, not just this slot. A baked scale can never revert, so this
 * quote can never take down a cook; `minOut` is the sole atomic backstop, the same read-off-chain-
 * and-bake posture zerofi/WOOFi/BisonFi already use. If a later pass recovers the oracle's byte
 * transform, the off-chain read collapses to a plain account decode — a simplification, not a
 * redesign. (The venue's OWN swap instruction still prices via the oracle — its business, only when
 * Metric is elected — a normal per-slot swap failure, never a quote-time whole-cook abort.)
 *
 * POOL ACCOUNT LAYOUT (variable length — 8 distinct sizes observed across a live sweep, 780 through
 * 1932 bytes, gcd of the size deltas 36 — a variable-length tail this adapter does not decode; see
 * the caveat below):
 *   +74   mintA (32B)          +106  vaultA (32B, SPL)
 *   +138  mintB (32B)          +170  vaultB (32B, SPL)
 *   +234  oracleConfig (32B, oracle-program-owned)
 *
 * ORACLE CONFIG ACCOUNT: oracle-program-owned, 277 bytes on the ground-truth pool. The paired
 * PRICE account (a DIFFERENT oracle-program-owned account, NOT embedded in the pool itself) sits at
 * a fixed byte offset inside the oracle config account — recovered directly (`Buffer.indexOf` of the
 * known price account's raw pubkey bytes into the known oracle config's raw bytes): offset 103.
 *
 * SWAP INSTRUCTION (disc `0x01`, 27 bytes: `[0x01] ++ amountIn:u64 LE ++ [0x01] ++ direction:u8
 * (1 = mintA in / 0 = mintB in) ++ minOut:u128 LE`). 15 accounts, FIXED order regardless of
 * direction:
 *   0 owner (signer)     1 pool (writable)      2 mintA            3 mintB
 *   4 vaultA (writable)  5 vaultB (writable)    6 userAtaA (writable, ALWAYS mintA's side)
 *   7 userAtaB (writable, ALWAYS mintB's side)  8 tokenProgram(A)  9 tokenProgram(B)
 *   10 systemProgram      11 self (this program's own id)  12 oracleProgram
 *   13 oracleConfig       14 priceAccount
 *
 * CAPACITY: the pool's variable-length tail (36-byte stride) is a real depth/bin model this
 * adapter does NOT decode (unresolved — see the module doc's own caveat on this). Rather than
 * assume the flat oracle price holds at unbounded size (measured flat only across the oracle
 * itself, never against the venue's real fill depth), the ladder caps every quote at
 * `liveReserveOut / CAP_DIVISOR` — the same conservative, deliberately-narrow posture zerofi's own
 * `CAP_DIVISOR` doc explains for the identical reason (an unmeasured true depth model + a flat
 * price is unsafe unbounded; a reserve-fraction ceiling is a safe, real, measurable substitute).
 * Tokenkeg-only (both mints on the ground-truth pool are plain Tokenkeg; a Token-2022 leg is out of
 * scope, unverified against this adapter, matching every other Tokenkeg-only adapter's own scope
 * note).

 * oracle-priced PMM fills at a flat price with NO slippage curve (a capacity-aware bin-walk would
 * address slippage that measurably does not exist here), so the flat stateless rung is correct and
 * the only correction needed is this small constant offset. The offset itself is the oracle's own
 * bid/ask micro-spread plus price drift between the off-chain bake and the on-chain cook slot, not a
 * curve.
 *
 * The haircut is set an order of magnitude above the measured ~4 ppm so `predicted <= realized`
 * holds with margin across the whole measured size range AND absorbs additional bake-to-cook oracle
 * micro-drift over a real routing window. Priced INTO the scale (not deducted afterward), so
 * `continuousFees` stays the identity — the same convention zerofi/obric-v2 use. An under-quote is
 * safe (at worst Metric is not elected when it was marginally best); an over-quote is the hazard
 * this removes, because Metric's own swap reverts if its `minOut` is unmet and the engine's CATCH is
 * pre-flight-only, so an over-optimistic quote is a whole-cook-abort risk, not just a bad fill.
