/**
 * Quantum venue (QuaNtZsgYRe5Z9Bk4LZ4cTD9tbkVoyCNf1R2BN9bBDv) — a
 * PUSH-QUOTE PMM whose whole curve is a per-direction array of discrete
 * (price, size) LEVELS stored in PLAINTEXT in the pool account, each with its
 * own expiry slot. Ladder-only (adapter contract v2), like manifest: a quote
 * is a best-first walk over the levels, which does not fit the
 * one-adapter-one-pool v1 emitQuote shape.
 *
 * LAYOUT (source-verified by reversing the deployed .text and confirmed
 * against 27 live mainnet pools, all 2280 bytes; every integer u64 LE):
 *
 *   0    mint0            32   mint1            64  vault0        96  vault1
 *   128  reserve0 (u64)   136  reserve1 (u64)
 *   144  side0 struct  (784 bytes)     928  side1 struct  (784 bytes)
 *   0x6e0 dec0 (u8)  0x6e1 dec1 (u8)  0x6e3 levelCount (u8, BOTH sides)
 *
 *   side struct: levels[16] of { price u64, cum u64 } @+0 (16 bytes each),
 *                expirySlot[16] u64 @+256, kind[16] u8 @+384.
 *
 *   side1 (@928) serves token0-in/token1-out; side0 (@144) serves
 *   token1-in/token0-out. `cum` is the level's size in OUTPUT raw units;
 *   `price` is scaled so that input = out * price / 10^outDecimals.
 *   `expirySlot` is scaled by 1e4: a level is LIVE iff
 *   expirySlot / 10000 >= Clock::slot (a per-level gate, not a whole-pool
 *   revert — the venue simply SKIPS an expired level, .text 0x1058).
 *
 * QUOTE (the exact program, .text 0xd40 walk / 0x1558+0x1a00 full-level need /
 * 0x1ac8+0x1e30 partial / 0x20c0-0x2328 partial bisect / 0x10ad0 reserve gate):
 *
 *   n     = 10^decimals(outToken);  S2 = 2n
 *   pp_i  = price of level i-1 (level 0: its own price -> a flat first level).
 *           By ORIGINAL index, expired-or-not (0xfd0) — NOT the last live one.
 *   need_i = floor((pp_i + p_i) * c_i / S2)                 <- the TRAPEZOID
 *   walk: rem = amountIn; for each LIVE level i in order:
 *           if rem == 0: stop
 *           if rem >= need_i: out += c_i; rem -= need_i
 *           else:            out += maxFill(rem, i); stop
 *         if rem > 0 after the last level: the venue REVERTS (err 0xe).
 *   maxFill(rem, i) = max{ m in [0, c_i] : cost_i(m) <= rem }
 *   cost_i(m)       = floor((2*pp_i + floor((p_i - pp_i)*m / c_i)) * m / S2)
 *
 *   The inner floor is the venue's own (0x2168) — a LINEAR price ramp from
 *   pp_i at m=0 to p_i at m=c_i, i.e. a convex intra-level cost. The venue
 *   inverts it by bisection; ./ladder.ts inverts it with an exact 64-step
 *   binary-digit descent (same answer, static step count).
 *
 *   Then: out == 0 -> the venue reverts (err 0xd, a dust trade);
 *         out > min(reserveOut, outVault.amount) -> the venue reverts
 *         (err 0xe, .text 0x10ad0). Both are CAPACITY, not curve: the ladder
 *         SATURATES (see ladder.ts's capacityInputVar).
 *
 * A post-trade write-back (.text 0x10c50-0x110f8) bumps every level's price by
 * (1 + N/D) with D = 1e4*pool[0x6f0], N = pool[0x6e8]*amount + (amount >
 * pool[0x700] ? pool[0x6f8]*D/1e4 : 0) — a per-POOL impact constant set
 * (observed 1/1e8/5/5e6 and 1/3e8/1/5e6, never a program constant). It runs
 * AFTER the output is computed, so it never enters a quote; it is the reason a
 * second Quantum slot on the SAME pool in one cook would be mispriced (the
 * shape key is per-pool-per-direction, so that cannot happen).
 *
 * SHIPPED PREFIX. fetchPoolConfig freezes the maximal level prefix that is
 * walkable: it stops at the first level with price == 0 (a 0-price level after
 * a nonzero one makes the venue's own `p_i >= pp_i` gate REVERT, and a leading
 * one leaves the trapezoid's pp == 0) or a price DROP (same gate — one live
 * mainnet side has a sawtooth 100/300/100/... ladder that the venue itself
 * cannot walk past level 1). Levels with cum == 0 are no-ops and are kept in
 * place so the next level's prev-price index stays the venue's. Truncating is
 * a CAPACITY CLAMP, never an over-quote: the walk books no input for a level
 * it did not ship, so the venue never reaches one.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION, deliberately NOT a gate here (sequence, not a blocker): the
 * swap instruction compares the transaction's OUTERMOST instruction program id
 * against a hardcoded list of 15 aggregator ids and returns Custom(9) at 656 CU
 * on no match. Sauce is not on that list today. The adapter is complete and
 * wei-exact regardless; whitelisting is an integration step, and the per-level
 * expiry is modeled as a SELF-DROP (skip the level) rather than a revert so a
 * stale ladder degrades instead of killing the cook.
 *
 * Gates (named errors; everything value-bearing stays a LIVE read):
 * - account size / program owner;
 * - non-classic-SPL mints (the swap is Tokenkeg-only here);
 * - a direction with no walkable level prefix (empty/parked ladder side).
 *
 * NOTE — RELOCATED LADDER. This venue's merge-decomposition ladder used to sit
 * next to this file as `./ladder.ts`; it now lives in the consuming recipes
 * package, which defines every `*Ladder`, window selector and rung-feeding
 * decomposition helper itself. The SDK keeps only the generic venue
 * integration below (pool-account decode, program ids, pool-config types, and
 * the AMM/tick math the decode needs). Every `ladder.ts` reference in the text
 * above therefore points at that relocated module, not at a file in this
 * directory.
