/**
 * Riptide venue adapter — a closed-source prop AMM (program
 * `riptK81hDxhe5pW5jSzSM9iRA8azgEgLJ4dXkPtBS7j`). No on-chain Anchor IDL
 * ships for this program, so the account layout and swap instruction below
 * are recovered by binary/account inspection (the same method used for
 * obric-v2 / solfi-v2 / bisonfi) — transaction archaeology via
 * `getSignaturesForAddress` + `getTransaction` over ~15 real landed swaps
 * across two pairs (USDT/USDC and wSOL/USDC) and both directions,
 * cross-checked with `simulateTransaction` probes (`sigVerify:false`)
 * against the deployed program at 5 sizes spanning three orders of
 * magnitude (1 to 500 raw-unit-scaled) in both directions on the live
 * USDT/USDC pool (`6Vzx4ASRjUPW2yBxHdBT3hDam2zxB6UmhM2MYYM5k8ci`).
 *
 * This file is the off-chain decode + CPI-account layer (PoolConfig,
 * fetchPoolConfig, quoteAccounts). The on-chain quote fragment
 * (SvmVenueLadder) lives in ladder.ts.
 *
 * ── Account layout (pool account, 1024 bytes, gated at fetch) ──
 * Recovered the same way obric-v2/solfi-v2 do: decode candidate offsets,
 * confirm against a real pool's own known mint addresses.
 *   OFF_MINT_A = 72   (pubkey, 32 bytes)
 *   OFF_MINT_B = 104  (pubkey, 32 bytes)
 * There is NO stored vault address anywhere in the 1024-byte account (an
 * exhaustive raw-byte scan for either vault's real address came back empty)
 * — instead, **the pool account itself is the vault authority**: every real
 * withdrawal/swap transaction inspected has the POOL's own address as the
 * `authority` signing the outbound SPL transfer from each vault (confirmed
 * on the `MarketWithdraw` instruction and on every `SwapExactIn` reverse-leg
 * transfer). That means each vault is exactly the pool's own **Associated
 * Token Account** for that mint — `vaultA = ATA(owner: pool, mint: mintA)`,
 * `vaultB = ATA(owner: pool, mint: mintB)`, the standard SPL derivation
 * (`ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL`) — INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED
 * by recomputing both ATAs off-chain for two real pools (the USDT/USDC pool
 * above and the wSOL/USDC pool `7qvjJJZVh9fk2ZTYCpSjoexYomVPr7qtNTFF3ey4JcjQ`)
 * and matching every one of the 4 resulting addresses to the vaults real
 * transactions actually used. This needs zero extra RPC calls (pure PDA
 * arithmetic from the pool address + the two decoded mints), unlike a
 * stored-vault-pubkey family.
 *
 * ── No partner/authority signer blocker (unlike BisonFi) ──
 * Every account this instruction needs is either the trader's own signer or
 * a pool-derived/constant address Sauce can resolve itself — there is NO
 * required 9th-signer partner authority the way BisonFi needed. This was
 * DIRECTLY CONFIRMED, not merely inferred from the account list:
 * `simulateTransaction` probes used the pool owner's real, currently-funded
 * wallet (`CGYAxnDF1bYwmbzTtVx2pdo8xd3aviqE58WumVYRLYRH`, a DIFFERENT key
 * from any router/authority PDA seen in the real transactions observed) as
 * the sole signer and succeeded at every size/direction tried — proving
 * this program accepts ANY owner-of-the-source-ATA as signer, not a
 * whitelisted partner key. Landing a real cook needs no separate grant.
