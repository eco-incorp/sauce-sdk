/**
 * RunnerRodeo (program `runnrXXdsSRkdueCRYxKDvSWfv6nAnrG5dcM29qj1HA`) — a bonding-curve
 * launch-AMM, no published IDL, no anchor.projects/GitHub source found. EVERYTHING below is
 * ground-truthed against REAL mainnet state and REAL simulated + landed transactions on the
 * deployed program (no third-party SDK, no assumptions):
 *
 *  - `getSignaturesForAddress` + `getTransaction` on a real landed SELL
 *    (`25vT8CzEZJjMaoKjw8AuHG6pnqkU4ekNBsseswD9ZwjwvetQQ4rMPWeLCxpJkb3z5hBytiTvvN28mtV5kiEwPAAG`,
 *    slot 418131643) and a real landed BUY on the same pool, routed via Jupiter's RouteV2
 *    (`4zRoTtapfsFT2nQ3oej6QgwmTrWyjY2kLTTUH8pwD4nEMZAxmLLJQxFnWycCUPNbYNF7N2BDdMZdMq87Upikt6Sd`)
 *    gave the exact 18-account order, the instruction discriminator + arg layout, and the fee
 *    split (see FEE MODEL below) byte-exact from the inner `transferChecked`s.
 *  - The pool-state PDA's raw bytes (`getAccountInfo`, base64) were reverse engineered by
 *    scanning every byte offset for known pubkeys (mints/vaults/config) and, for the numeric
 *    reserve fields, by SOLVING for the exact virtual-reserve constants from the landed
 *    trades' pre/post vault deltas, then CONFIRMING the closed form against 8 independent
 *    real `simulateTransaction` calls (`sigVerify:false`) at sizes spanning 1e6 to 1.5e13
 *    raw units (both directions) — every one matched the program's real output BIT-EXACT
 *    (see VALIDATION below). The program's own binary was additionally dumped
 *    (`solana program dump`, ELF loader-owned, 946,792 bytes) to measure the real CPI's CU
 *    cost (see sauce-recipes' `the consuming app SVM CU-budget module`'s `CU_FAMILIES['runner-rodeo']` comment).
 *
 * POOL-STATE ACCOUNT (313 bytes, Anchor-discriminated, disc = d5d2e3bf30aade72 — gated at
 * fetch time):
 *   configAccount    Pubkey @8      creatorRef (unused) Pubkey @40
 *   baseVault        Pubkey @72     quoteVault          Pubkey @104
 *   totalSupplyLike  u64    @136 (unused by the curve — looks like a fixed 800,000,000-token
 *                                  constant; kept undecoded, not needed for the quote)
 *   virtualBaseRaw   u64    @144   quoteVirtualOffset   u64 @152
 *   virtualBaseSub   u64    @160   quoteCacheMirror     u64 @168 (mirrors the live quote
 *                                  vault balance exactly at last touch — unused, we read the
 *                                  live vault instead so a re-fetch is never stale)
 *   unused           u64    @176   unused byte          u8  @184
 *   baseMint         Pubkey @185   quoteMint            Pubkey @217
 *   reserved/padding        @249..313 (all-zero on every account sampled)
 *
 * THE CURVE (fully closed form, EXACT — not a haircut): the program does NOT use the raw
 * vault balances as its constant-product reserves at all (a naive `vault*vault` model
 * mis-predicts every trade by >20x) — it uses two DERIVED reserves:
 *   R_eff (effective base reserve) = virtualBaseRaw - virtualBaseSub   (BOTH from pool-state,
 *                                    read live — never cached, since either could move on a
 *                                    real trade)
 *   Q_eff (effective quote reserve) = liveQuoteVaultBalance + quoteVirtualOffset
 * BUY  (quoteToBase, exact quote in `x`):
 *   fees = floor(x*creatorFeeBps/1e4) + floor(x*protoBpsA/1e4) + floor(x*protoBpsB/1e4)
 *   net  = x - fees  (0 if net <= 0)
 *   out  = floor(R_eff * net / (Q_eff + net))
 * SELL (baseToQuote, exact base in `x`):
 *   gross = floor(Q_eff * x / (R_eff + x))
 *   fees  = floor(gross*creatorFeeBps/1e4) + floor(gross*protoBpsA/1e4) + floor(gross*protoBpsB/1e4)
 *   out   = fees >= gross ? 0 : gross - fees
 * Every floor is a real integer division (no ceiling anywhere, unlike pumpfun-bonding-curve's
 * per-component ceilDiv) — confirmed component-by-component against 8 real trades, not just
 * the net total (see VALIDATION).
 *
 * FEE MODEL: three components, ALL read LIVE from the pool's `configAccount` (never
 * hardcoded, so a live bps change is picked up on the next fetch) — `creatorFeeBps` (u16 @73,
 * =60 observed), `protocolFeeBpsA` (u16 @75, =5 observed), `protocolFeeBpsB` (u16 @77, =55
 * observed); a second, byte-identical [60,5,55] triple sits at @79/81/83 in the same account
 * (unexplained — possibly a redundant/secondary tier — the FIRST triple is what every
 * validated trade matches, so that is the one this module reads). The creator-fee VAULT is
 * DERIVED per pool: `configAccount`'s own Pubkey @9 (a partner/creator wallet, DIFFERENT per
 * pool observed to coincide with the fee vault's real SPL owner) ATA'd against the pool's
 * quote mint under the classic Token program. The two protocol-fee VAULTS
 * (`PROTOCOL_FEE_VAULT_A`/`_B` below) are NOT derivable from either account (exhaustively
 * scanned for both a literal-pubkey match and a short-seed PDA match — neither hit) — both
 * are owned, in the SPL sense, by the `["authority"]` PDA (itself a plain, provably
 * program-wide constant, see AUTHORITY below), so they are hardcoded here as PROTOCOL-WIDE
 * constants, the same disclosed-constant pattern pumpfun-bonding-curve's own module uses for
 * its own `GLOBAL`/`FEE_CONFIG`/`EVENT_AUTHORITY`. If RunnerRodeo ever rotates them this
 * module needs a re-pin — there is no way to detect that from on-chain data alone without a
 * second pool to diff against.
 *
 * GLOBAL PDAs (both independently RE-DERIVED via `getProgramDerivedAddress` and confirmed
 * byte-for-byte against the real accounts used in both landed transactions — not guesses):
 *   AUTHORITY       = PDA(["authority"], program)          = 7Eg1rRYr2WqEWTvqkzG1ApuB91WbZ4qzY7V6BfXtjwQR
 *   EVENT_AUTHORITY = PDA(["__event_authority"], program)  = KND1vJVGccL2qojg6qidWH4hN7VGgL3sRwUXfVbwQQX
 * (the latter is Anchor's standard self-CPI event-log account — hardcoded rather than
 * re-derived per fetch since it never varies by pool, matching every other family's constant
 * PDAs in this repo.)
 *
 * SCOPE (a real, disclosed narrowing, not a refusal — mirrors pumpfun-bonding-curve's own
 * SCOPE section): this module serves only WSOL-quoted pools (`quoteMint` == the wSOL mint —
 * the only variant observed live; gated at fetch time, named error otherwise). On the base
 * mint's Token-2022 `TransferFeeConfig`: the real validated pool's mint carries an ACTIVE fee
 * (120bps, confirmed live via `getAccountInfo` jsonParsed — an EARLIER draft of this module
 * wrongly inferred "inactive" from vault deltas alone, see `mintTransferFeeConfig`'s doc for
 * the correction), but `withdrawWithheldAuthority` on that mint is the pool's own
 * `["authority"]` PDA, and the `Swap` instruction unconditionally self-harvests via a nested
 * `WithdrawWithheldTokensFromAccounts` CPI after every transfer (visible in every real
 * transaction's logs), netting the fee to zero real effect — this is why this module gates on
 * `withdrawWithheldAuthority == AUTHORITY`, not on the bps value or the extension's mere
 * presence the way pumpfun-bonding-curve's blanket rejection does (that blanket rejection
 * would incorrectly self-drop the exact pool this module is validated against): a mint whose
 * fee is NOT harvestable by this program's own authority would corrupt the constant-product
 * math above (which assumes the full requested amount reaches the vault), so THAT combination
 * is rejected instead.
 *
 * VALIDATION (sauce-recipes' `test/svm/venues/runner-rodeo.test.ts` pins these as golden
 * values — real `simulateTransaction` calls against the deployed program, current mainnet
 * pool state, `R_eff=1015974936239489`,
 * `Q_eff=liveQuoteVaultBalance(899666879)+19681274900`):
 *   SELL    1,000,000,000 base in -> gross   20,257 / net    20,015 quote
 *   SELL 1,000,000,000,000 base in -> gross 20,237,412 / net 19,994,565 quote
 *   SELL 5,000,000,000,000 base in -> gross 100,790,631 / net 99,581,145 quote
 *   SELL 15,000,000,000,000 base in -> gross 299,439,022 / net 295,845,755 quote
 *   BUY      1,000,000 quote in -> net in    988,000 -> 48,770,122,519 base out
 *   BUY     10,000,000 quote in -> net in  9,880,000 -> 487,490,614,885 base out
 *   BUY    100,000,000 quote in -> net in 98,800,000 -> 4,853,944,733,603 base out
 *   BUY  1,000,000,000 quote in -> net in 988,000,000 -> 46,538,362,766,685 base out
 * Every one of the 8 reproduces the real program's output to the integer, both the gross/net
 * split (per-component floor) and the curve itself.
