/**
 * WHERE THE DEPLOYED SAUCE v12 STACK LIVES.
 *
 * The package already shipped the engine's ABIs (`sdk/dist/artifacts/`) and the
 * v12 runtime creation code, but not the ADDRESSES of the deployed contracts —
 * so a consumer could encode a call and had nowhere to send it, and
 * `createSauceSvmClient` (which takes a required `programId`) had no default to
 * offer. This module closes that: the addresses come from the pinned engine's
 * own deploy record, vendored by `pnpm --filter './sdk' sync-engine-artifacts`
 * into `v12.generated.ts`, so they cannot drift from the pinned engine.
 *
 * The EVM addresses are CREATE2-deterministic — factory + salt + initcode only,
 * with no deployer or nonce in the preimage — so they are IDENTICAL on every
 * chain. That is why this exposes one flat address set plus per-chain liveness
 * rather than repeating the same three addresses twelve times. Do not read that
 * as "the stack is live everywhere": liveness is per chain, and one chain in the
 * record is not live (see `v12FailedChainIds`).
