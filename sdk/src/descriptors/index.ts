/**
 * Contract descriptor layer — links a protocol's addresses.ts role key, its
 * abis.ts export, and a human contract name into one queryable
 * ContractDescriptor, with a chain-keyed forward/reverse index on top.
 *
 * See links.ts for the linkage table and its module doc comment for scope
 * (a starter set of 15 protocols, not all ~128), and query.ts for the query
 * API. `describeContract`/`requireContract` are the thin resolver the
 * fluent accessor tree (`Base.Uniswap.UniversalRouter.method`, a separate,
 * later piece of work) is built on top of.
