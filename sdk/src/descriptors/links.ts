/**
 * THE CRUX: role-key <-> ABI-export <-> human-contract-name linkage.
 *
 * `addresses.ts` keys per-chain addresses by a free-form role string
 * ("factory", "swapRouter02", …) and `abis.ts` exports `<Name>ABI` arrays —
 * nothing in the existing registry data connects the two, or names the
 * resulting contract for a human/accessor tree. That link genuinely isn't
 * derivable end to end from the data (see the name-normalization measurement
 * below), so it is hand-authored here, one entry per descriptor, and
 * cross-checked against the live vendored data by
 * `test/descriptors-linkage.test.ts` — a role key or ABI export that stops
 * existing fails that suite immediately rather than silently producing a
 * stale/hole descriptor.
 *
 * SCOPE (v1): a STARTER SET of 15 protocols with clean, unambiguous linkage —
 * NOT an attempt to auto-link all ~128 registry protocols. Excluded, with
 * reasons that are data, not taste:
 *  - curve, lido, compound-v2, benqi, moonwell, venus, silo, layerbank:
 *    role key <-> ABI export name mismatches that need a human judgment call
 *    (`lido.stETH` vs `LidoABI`; `curve.threePool` is a StableSwap INSTANCE,
 *    not a role naming a single ABI-typed contract).
 *  - every bridge (l1-side / l2-side role pairs are a per-chain-SIDE axis this model
 *    has no slot for yet).
 *  - maker / alchemix / olympus / tokemak / stargate and similar: role keys
 *    are majority plain ERC20 token addresses, not protocol contracts.
 *
 * `contract` is the human display name. When omitted it is DERIVED (never
 * invented) by `deriveContractName` in derive.ts: `abiExport` minus its
 * trailing "ABI" minus the protocol-name prefix. Only entries that would
 * otherwise collide, or that have no `abiExport` to derive from, carry an
 * explicit override — see the comments below.
