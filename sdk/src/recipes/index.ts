/**
 * @eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/recipes — reusable Sauce recipes shipped as SOURCE.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR: a partner reproduces our bytecode with the ORDINARY compiler
 * (`@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/compiler`), not a bespoke helper. This module exists only to answer the
 * two questions a partner genuinely cannot answer themselves — "what is the program text?" and
 * "where is this package installed?" — and then gets out of the way. Every compile option stays
 * explicit at the call site, so what you pass is what you can audit:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { compile } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/compiler";
 * import { settleSource, SAUCE_BASE_DIRS } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/recipes";
 *
 * const { bytecode } = compile(settleSource(), {
 *   baseDirs: SAUCE_BASE_DIRS,   // resolves the program's `./artifacts/IERC20.json` import
 *   target: "v12",               // the program is v12-only
 *   treeshake: true,
 *   tsSource: true,              // the source is TypeScript-annotated SauceScript
 *   args: [tokens.map(BigInt), minOut, BigInt(recipient)],
 * });
 * // bytecode[0] is byte-identical to the program we hand you.
 * ```
 *
 * Those five options are the whole contract — change any of them and the bytes change. They are
 * deliberately NOT exported as a pre-baked options object: a partner reproducing our output should
 * see the target and the arg order, not inherit them from a constant they never read.
 *
 * PREFER `settleSource()` OVER READING THE FILE YOURSELF, but both work — the raw asset is a
 * real file inside the package and is reachable by subpath if you want to hash, diff, or vendor it:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const path = fileURLToPath(import.meta.resolve("@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/recipes/settle.sauce.ts"));
 * ```
 *
 * A bare `readFileSync("@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/...")` does NOT work — `readFileSync` takes a
 * filesystem path and performs no package resolution. Use either form above.
 *
 * To go the other direction — compiled bytecode back to `(tokens, minOut, recipient)` — use
 * `@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/verify`'s `decodeSettleProgram`, whose dependency closure is `viem` only.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS EVM/v12 ONLY. The SVM twin — the SVM `settle.sauce.ts`, same contract, adapted to
 * SPL's account model — lives under the SVM subtree with the rest of the SVM SDK and is exported from
 * `@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/svm` (`svmSettleSource` / `svmSettleRefs`); see
 * `sdk/src/svm/recipes/index.ts`.
