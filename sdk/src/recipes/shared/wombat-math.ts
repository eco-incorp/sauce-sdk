/**
 * Wombat Exchange (single-sided stableswap) — VERBATIM bigint replay + off-chain segment sampler.
 *
 * THE SINGLE SOURCE for Wombat swap math. Imported by BOTH:
 *   - the production `prepare.ts` (buildWombatSegments), and
 *   - the neutral oracle `ecoswap.optimal.ts` (wombatSegments),
 * so the split is exact-on-grid vs the oracle by construction (one replay), and the per-pool
 * executed output == quotePotentialSwap(awarded share) to the wei (one atomic pool.swap).
 *
 * THE WOMBAT MATH IS OFF-CHAIN ONLY (for the SPLIT). The on-chain solver does NOT recompute the
 * coverage-ratio quote or the closed-form quadratic — it samples the curve OFF-CHAIN into
 * (capacity, effOut, marginalOI) SEGMENTS via this exact replay, consumes them as STATIC segments
 * through the existing static-segment cursor (the same machinery the merge uses for route / Curve /
 * LB / DODO / Solidly-stable segments), and EXECUTES each Wombat pool CALLBACK-FREE: an on-chain
 * `pool.quotePotentialSwap(fromToken, toToken, awardedShare)` staticcall yields the EXACT
 * potentialOutcome (the pool view == the pool swap math), the pool is approved for the awarded
 * input (Wombat PULLS via transferFrom), and `pool.swap(fromToken, toToken, awarded, minToAmount,
 * to, deadline)` lands the swap. No engine SwapPoolType is needed (Wombat is single-sided
 * stableswap, NOT xy=k, so the V2/UniV2 _swapV2 path mis-prices it).
 *
 * SOURCE MIRRORED — the canonical wombat-exchange/v1-core `CoreV2.sol` + `Pool.sol`. Reproduced
 * bit-for-bit (all internal math is WAD = 1e18 signed fixed point; cash/liability are stored in WAD
 * regardless of token decimals; fromAmount is native→WAD via toWad, the quote out is WAD→native via
 * fromWad):
 *   CoreV2._swapQuoteFunc(Ax, Ay, Lx, Ly, Dx, A):           # Ax/Ay = from/to cash, Lx/Ly = from/to liability
 *     D   = Ax + Ay - A·wmul((Lx·Lx)/Ax + (Ly·Ly)/Ay)       # the invariant (a constant of the pre-state)
 *     rx_ = (Ax + Dx)·wdiv(Lx)                               # post coverage ratio of the from-asset
 *     b   = (Lx·(rx_ - A·wdiv(rx_)))/Ly - D·wdiv(Ly)         # the quadratic coefficient
 *     ry_ = _solveQuad(b, A)                                 # closed-form: (sqrt(b·b + 4·A·WAD) - b)/2
 *     Dy  = Ly·wmul(ry_) - Ay                                # ideal to-amount (WAD; negative ⇒ |Dy|)
 *   Pool._quoteFrom / quotePotentialSwap:
 *     haircut       = idealToAmount·wmul(haircutRate)        # the LP fee, taken off the OUTPUT
 *     actualToAmount = idealToAmount - haircut
 *   wmul(a,b) = round((a·b)/WAD) ; wdiv(a,b) = round((a·WAD)/b) — canonical SignedSafeMath ADDS the
 *   half-term (WAD/2, y/2) before the truncate-toward-zero divide ; _solveQuad uses an integer sqrt.
 *
 * The replay is CLOSED-FORM (one isqrt + a handful of mulDiv) — NO Newton, NO unbounded loop. It
 * runs purely on the read pool state (fromCash, toCash, fromLiability, toLiability, ampFactor,
 * haircutRate, decimals); buildWombatSegments makes NO extra RPC.
 *
 * WEI-EXACT BOUND. The SPLIT (per-pool awarded input) is EXACT-ON-GRID vs the oracle (both replay
 * the SAME buildWombatSegments grid — one source — so the awarded share matches the oracle
 * bit-for-bit). The realized dy is EXACT-IN-DY: the per-pool out for the awarded slice is
 * re-evaluated wei-exact by ONE atomic pool.quotePotentialSwap(Σ share) at execution, because the
 * pool's `quotePotentialSwap` view IS the math its `swap` enforces (Pool.swap calls the same
 * _quoteFrom). So awarded-input == oracle (exact-on-grid) and received-dy ==
 * quotePotentialSwap(awarded) (exact-in-dy) — the same standard as Curve / DODO / Solidly-stable.
 * Marginal equalization across pools is a DIAGNOSTIC (a grid bound), not the wei gate.
