/**
 * Installs the eco-routes chain accessors (and the `chain` front door) as
 * DEFAULT GLOBALS, so a consumer writes `Base.route(reward).Solana(route)`
 * with zero import. Registry-derived by construction: it enumerates
 * `chainAccessors` (itself generated from `../chains/canonical.js` by
 * `createChainAccessors`), so adding a chain to `CANONICAL_CHAINS` adds a
 * global with no code change here.
 *
 * Imported for its side effect from `../index.js` -- see the comment there
 * for why that import must stay a BARE one (it is what carries the ambient
 * `declare global` block in `./globals.generated.js` into a consumer's type
 * graph, not just the runtime install).
 *
 * Reversible, in order of how much it undoes:
 *  1. `globalThis.__ECO_ROUTES_NO_GLOBALS__ = true` before importing the SDK
 *     skips the runtime install entirely (ambient types still resolve --
 *     see the module doc on `index.ts` for why that's a type-only nuisance,
 *     not a wrong program).
 *  2. `uninstallRouteGlobals()` removes whatever this module installed.
 *  3. `installRouteGlobals({ includeChain: false })` / `{ target }` re-runs
 *     with a narrower scope.
 *  4. Deleting the two lines in `../index.js` removes both the runtime
 *     install AND the ambient types together (see that file).
 *
 * Never clobbers a name already present on the target -- see
 * `installRouteGlobals` below.
