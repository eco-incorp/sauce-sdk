# Aave V2

Legacy version of Aave lending protocol. Still holds significant TVL on Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche.

## Category
lending | Chains: Ethereum (1), Polygon (137), Avalanche (43114)

## SauceScript Functions

### deposit
Deposit assets into the lending pool to earn interest. Mints aTokens to the depositor.
```typescript
import { LendingPoolABI as ILendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = ILendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  pool.deposit(asset, amount, onBehalfOf, 0);
  return 1;
}
```
- `lendingPoolAddress`: LendingPool contract for the target chain
- `asset`: ERC-20 token address to deposit
- `amount`: Amount in token's native decimals (e.g. 1e6 for 1 USDC). Use `type(uint256).max` to deposit entire balance
- `onBehalfOf`: Address that receives the aTokens (use msg.sender for self)
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the LendingPool before calling

### withdraw
Withdraw deposited assets by burning aTokens.
```typescript
import { LendingPoolABI as ILendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, to: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = ILendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  return pool.withdraw(asset, amount, to);
}
```
- `amount`: Amount to withdraw. Use `type(uint256).max` to withdraw entire deposited balance
- `to`: Address that receives the underlying tokens
- Returns the actual withdrawn amount

### borrow
Borrow assets against deposited collateral.
```typescript
import { LendingPoolABI as ILendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, interestRateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = ILendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  pool.borrow(asset, amount, interestRateMode, 0, onBehalfOf);
  return 1;
}
```
- `interestRateMode`: 1 = stable rate, 2 = variable rate. Variable is more common and typically lower
- `onBehalfOf`: Address that receives the debt tokens (must have delegated credit if not msg.sender)
- Must have sufficient collateral deposited first

### repay
Repay borrowed assets to reduce debt.
```typescript
import { LendingPoolABI as ILendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, rateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = ILendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  return pool.repay(asset, amount, rateMode, onBehalfOf);
}
```
- `rateMode`: Must match the rate mode of the existing debt (1 = stable, 2 = variable)
- `amount`: Use `type(uint256).max` to repay entire debt
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the LendingPool
- Returns the actual repaid amount

## Deployed Addresses

| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Ethereum | lendingPool | `0x7d2768dE32b0b80b7a3454c06BdAc94A69DDc7A9` |
| Polygon | lendingPool | `0x8dFf5E27EA6b7AC08EbFdf9eB090F32ee9a30fcf` |
| Avalanche | lendingPool | `0x4F01AeD16D97E3aB5ab2B501154DC9bb0F1A5A2C` |

## ABI Reference

### LendingPoolABI
- `deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)` - Deposit asset into pool
- `withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) returns (uint256)` - Withdraw asset from pool
- `borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf)` - Borrow asset
- `repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 rateMode, address onBehalfOf) returns (uint256)` - Repay borrowed asset

## Notes
- interestRateMode: 1 = stable, 2 = variable. Most users use variable rate
- referralCode is always 0 (referral program inactive)
- Legacy protocol -- consider Aave V3 for new deployments
- All deposit/repay operations require prior ERC-20 approval to the LendingPool address
- TVL: $2B+. Audited
