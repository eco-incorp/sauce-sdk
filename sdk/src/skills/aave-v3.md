# Aave V3

Non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets. The most widely deployed lending protocol in DeFi.

## Category
lending | Chains: Ethereum (1), Polygon (137), Arbitrum (42161), Optimism (10), Avalanche (43114), Base (8453), BSC (56), Scroll (534352), Fantom (250), Gnosis (100), Metis (1088)

## SauceScript Functions

### supply
Supply assets to earn interest. Mints aTokens to the supplier.
```typescript
import { PoolABI as IPool } from "./abis";

function main(poolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IPool.at(poolAddress);
  pool.supply(asset, amount, onBehalfOf, 0);
  return 1;
}
```
- `poolAddress`: Pool contract for the target chain
- `asset`: ERC-20 token address to supply
- `amount`: Amount in token's native decimals. Use `type(uint256).max` for entire balance
- `onBehalfOf`: Address that receives aTokens (use msg.sender for self)
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the Pool before calling

### withdraw
Withdraw supplied assets by burning aTokens.
```typescript
import { PoolABI as IPool } from "./abis";

function main(poolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, to: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IPool.at(poolAddress);
  return pool.withdraw(asset, amount, to);
}
```
- `amount`: Use `type(uint256).max` to withdraw entire balance
- Returns the actual withdrawn amount

### borrow
Borrow assets against supplied collateral.
```typescript
import { PoolABI as IPool } from "./abis";

function main(poolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, interestRateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IPool.at(poolAddress);
  pool.borrow(asset, amount, interestRateMode, 0, onBehalfOf);
  return 1;
}
```
- `interestRateMode`: 1 = stable (being phased out), 2 = variable. Use 2 for variable rate
- Must have sufficient collateral supplied first

### repay
Repay borrowed assets to reduce debt.
```typescript
import { PoolABI as IPool } from "./abis";

function main(poolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, interestRateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IPool.at(poolAddress);
  return pool.repay(asset, amount, interestRateMode, onBehalfOf);
}
```
- `interestRateMode`: Must match the debt type (1 = stable, 2 = variable)
- `amount`: Use `type(uint256).max` to repay entire debt
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the Pool

## ABI Reference

### PoolABI
- `supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)` - Supply asset to earn interest
- `withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) returns (uint256)` - Withdraw supplied asset
- `borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf)` - Borrow against collateral
- `repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, address onBehalfOf) returns (uint256)` - Repay borrowed debt
- `flashLoanSimple(address receiverAddress, address asset, uint256 amount, bytes params, uint16 referralCode)` - Single-asset flash loan (receiver must implement IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver)
- `liquidationCall(address collateralAsset, address debtAsset, address user, uint256 debtToCover, bool receiveAToken)` - Liquidate undercollateralized position (healthFactor < 1e18)
- `getUserAccountData(address user) returns (uint256 totalCollateralBase, uint256 totalDebtBase, uint256 availableBorrowsBase, uint256 currentLiquidationThreshold, uint256 ltv, uint256 healthFactor)` - Get account health data (view)

## Notes
- interestRateMode: 1 = stable (deprecated on most markets), 2 = variable
- referralCode is always 0 (referral program inactive)
- V3 introduced efficiency mode (eMode) for correlated assets, isolation mode for new assets, and siloed borrowing
- All supply/repay operations require prior ERC-20 approval to the Pool address
- healthFactor < 1e18 means position is liquidatable
- TVL: $40B+. Audited
