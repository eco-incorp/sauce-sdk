# Arbitrum Native Bridge

Official Arbitrum L1-L2 gateway bridge. Routes tokens through the canonical Arbitrum rollup bridge with 7-day withdrawal finality.

## Category
native L2 bridge | Direction: L1 to L2 (Ethereum to Arbitrum) | Chains: Ethereum (1), Arbitrum (42161)

## SauceScript Functions

### depositToL2
Deposit ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum L1 to Arbitrum L2 via the Gateway Router.
```typescript
import { ArbitrumL1GatewayRouterABI as IL1GatewayRouter } from "./abis";

function main(routerAddress: Address, token: Address, recipient: Address, amount: Uint256, maxGas: Uint256, gasPriceBid: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const router = IL1GatewayRouter.at(routerAddress);
  return router.outboundTransfer(token, recipient, amount, maxGas, gasPriceBid, 0x00);
}
```
- `token`: L1 ERC-20 token address to bridge
- `recipient`: Address to receive tokens on Arbitrum L2
- `amount`: Amount of tokens to deposit
- `maxGas`: Maximum L2 gas for the deposit transaction (e.g. 300000). Excess is refunded
- `gasPriceBid`: L2 gas price bid in wei. Use Arbitrum's `ArbGasInfo.getMinimumGasPrice()` or estimate
- `_data`: Extra data, typically `0x00` for standard deposits. Used for custom gateway params
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the appropriate gateway (use `getGateway(token)` to find it)
- Requires ETH as msg.value to cover L2 execution costs (`maxGas * gasPriceBid + maxSubmissionCost`)

## ABI Reference

### ArbitrumL1GatewayRouterABI
- `outboundTransfer(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _maxGas, uint256 _gasPriceBid, bytes _data) returns (bytes)` [payable] - Deposit tokens from L1 to L2. Routes to the correct gateway automatically based on the token
- `getGateway(address _token) returns (address)` - Look up the gateway contract for a specific token (view). Approve tokens to this address, not the router

## Notes
- **L1 to L2 only** via this contract. For L2 to L1 withdrawals, use `ArbSys.sendTxToL1()` on Arbitrum (takes 7 days)
- The router auto-routes tokens to the correct gateway (standard, custom, or WETH gateway)
- **Approval target**: approve tokens to the gateway returned by `getGateway(token)`, NOT to the router itself
- `msg.value` must cover: `maxSubmissionCost + (maxGas * gasPriceBid)` for L2 execution
- L1 to L2 deposits finalize in ~10-15 minutes (after L1 finality + sequencer inclusion)
- L2 to L1 withdrawals require 7-day challenge period before funds can be claimed on L1
- For ETH deposits, send ETH directly to the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox (no token approval needed)
- Canonical bridge -- no third-party risk, secured by the Arbitrum rollup itself
- Audited
