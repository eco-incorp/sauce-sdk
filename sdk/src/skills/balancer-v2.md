# Balancer V2

Generalized AMM with weighted pools, single Vault architecture, and flash loans. Supports custom pool types (weighted, stable, linear, composable stable) and multi-token pools with up to 8 tokens per pool.

## Category
dex | Chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis, Avalanche, Base, BSC

## Key Operations
- **swap**: Execute a single swap through the Vault specifying pool ID and assets
- **addLiquidity**: Join a pool by depositing tokens via the Vault
- **removeLiquidity**: Exit a pool by withdrawing tokens via the Vault

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco/sauce-sdk/protocols/balancer-v2";
```

## SauceScript Examples

### swap
```typescript
import { BalancerV2VaultABI as IVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, poolId: Bytes32, assetIn: Address, assetOut: Address, amount: Uint256, limit: Uint256, sender: Address, recipient: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.swap({poolId: poolId, kind: 0, assetIn: assetIn, assetOut: assetOut, amount: amount, userData: 0x00}, {sender: sender, fromInternalBalance: false, recipient: recipient, toInternalBalance: false}, limit, 99999999999);
}
```
- `vaultAddress`: The Balancer V2 Vault (same address on ALL chains: `0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8`)
- `poolId`: bytes32 identifier for the specific pool (encodes pool address + pool type + nonce)
- `assetIn` / `assetOut`: Token addresses to swap between
- `amount`: Input amount when `kind=0` (GIVEN_IN) or output amount when `kind=1` (GIVEN_OUT)
- `limit`: Maximum input (GIVEN_OUT) or minimum output (GIVEN_IN) for slippage protection
- `sender`: Address providing the input tokens (must have approved the Vault)
- `recipient`: Address receiving the output tokens
- `userData`: Extra data for the pool (usually `0x00` for swaps)
- `fromInternalBalance` / `toInternalBalance`: Use Vault internal balances (set false for standard swaps)

### addLiquidity
```typescript
import { BalancerV2VaultABI as IVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, poolId: Bytes32, sender: Address, recipient: Address, userData: Bytes): Uint256 {
  const vault = IVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.joinPool(poolId, sender, recipient, {assets: [], maxAmountsIn: [], userData: userData, fromInternalBalance: false});
}
```
- `userData`: ABI-encoded join type and amounts. Join types vary by pool kind (e.g., EXACT_TOKENS_IN_FOR_BPT_OUT, TOKEN_IN_FOR_EXACT_BPT_OUT)
- `assets`: Array of token addresses in the pool (must match pool composition order)
- `maxAmountsIn`: Maximum amounts to deposit per token (slippage protection)

### removeLiquidity
```typescript
import { BalancerV2VaultABI as IVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, poolId: Bytes32, sender: Address, recipient: Address, userData: Bytes): Uint256 {
  const vault = IVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.exitPool(poolId, sender, recipient, {assets: [], minAmountsOut: [], userData: userData, toInternalBalance: false});
}
```
- `userData`: ABI-encoded exit type and amounts. Exit types: EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ONE_TOKEN_OUT, EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT, BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT
- `minAmountsOut`: Minimum amounts to receive per token (slippage protection)

## ABI Methods

### BalancerV2VaultABI
- `swap(tuple(bytes32 poolId, uint8 kind, address assetIn, address assetOut, uint256 amount, bytes userData), tuple(address sender, bool fromInternalBalance, address recipient, bool toInternalBalance), uint256 limit, uint256 deadline) -> uint256 amountCalculated` - Execute a single swap. `kind`: 0=GIVEN_IN, 1=GIVEN_OUT
- `batchSwap(uint8 kind, tuple[](bytes32 poolId, uint256 assetInIndex, uint256 assetOutIndex, uint256 amount, bytes userData), address[] assets, tuple(address sender, bool fromInternalBalance, address recipient, bool toInternalBalance), int256[] limits, uint256 deadline) -> int256[] assetDeltas` - Execute multi-hop swap through multiple pools in one transaction
- `joinPool(bytes32 poolId, address sender, address recipient, tuple(address[] assets, uint256[] maxAmountsIn, bytes userData, bool fromInternalBalance))` - Deposit tokens into a pool
- `exitPool(bytes32 poolId, address sender, address recipient, tuple(address[] assets, uint256[] minAmountsOut, bytes userData, bool toInternalBalance))` - Withdraw tokens from a pool
- `flashLoan(address recipient, address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts, bytes userData)` - Flash loan from the Vault (zero fee for Balancer pools)
- `getPoolTokens(bytes32 poolId) -> (address[] tokens, uint256[] balances, uint256 lastChangeBlock)` - Query pool token composition and balances (view)

## Notes
- Single Vault contract holds ALL pool liquidity (same address `0xBA12...` on every chain)
- Pools are identified by `bytes32 poolId`, NOT by contract address
- The Vault model means tokens only need to be approved to ONE contract for all Balancer pools
- Weighted pools: custom token weights (e.g., 80/20 ETH/USDC); Stable pools: pegged assets; Linear pools: wrapping yield-bearing tokens
- `batchSwap` is gas-efficient for multi-hop trades since tokens only move between Vault internal accounts
- Flash loans from Balancer Vault are zero-fee when the swap route stays within Balancer pools
- Internal balances: users can keep tokens in the Vault to save gas on repeated trades
- `userData` encoding varies by pool type - check Balancer docs for the specific pool's join/exit types
- Use Balancer for multi-token pools (3+ tokens), weighted index exposure, or flash loans
