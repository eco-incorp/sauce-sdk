# Beefy Finance

Multi-chain yield optimizer. Auto-compounds rewards from LP tokens and other yield sources across many chains.

## Category
yield | Chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche

## Key Operations
- **deposit**: Deposit want tokens into Beefy vault
- **depositAll**: Deposit entire balance of want token
- **withdraw**: Withdraw by specifying share amount
- **withdrawAll**: Withdraw entire position

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco/sauce-sdk/protocols/beefy";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Deposit into Beefy vault
import { BeefyVaultABI as IBeefyVault } from "./abis";
function main(vaultAddress: Address, amount: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const vault = IBeefyVault.at(vaultAddress);
  vault.deposit(amount);
  return 1;
}

// Deposit entire balance
import { BeefyVaultABI as IBeefyVault } from "./abis";
function main(vaultAddress: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IBeefyVault.at(vaultAddress);
  vault.depositAll();
  return 1;
}

// Withdraw shares
import { BeefyVaultABI as IBeefyVault } from "./abis";
function main(vaultAddress: Address, shares: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const vault = IBeefyVault.at(vaultAddress);
  vault.withdraw(shares);
  return 1;
}

// Withdraw all
import { BeefyVaultABI as IBeefyVault } from "./abis";
function main(vaultAddress: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IBeefyVault.at(vaultAddress);
  vault.withdrawAll();
  return 1;
}
```

## ABI Methods
### BeefyVaultABI
- `deposit(uint256)` - Deposit want tokens, receive mooTokens (vault shares)
- `depositAll()` - Deposit entire want token balance
- `withdraw(uint256)` - Withdraw by burning shares
- `withdrawAll()` - Withdraw entire position
- `getPricePerFullShare()` - Current share price (18 decimals)
- `balance()` - Total want tokens in vault
- `balanceOf(address)` - Query mooToken (share) balance
- `want()` - Address of the underlying want token

## Notes
- TVL: $300M+. Each vault has a unique address per strategy
- Approve want token to vault before depositing
- Use want() to discover which token a vault accepts
- getPricePerFullShare() returns the exchange rate between shares and want tokens
- Auto-compounds rewards - no manual claiming needed
