# DODO

Proactive Market Maker (PMM) DEX with capital-efficient liquidity provision. Unlike constant product AMMs, DODO uses oracle-guided pricing to concentrate liquidity near market price. Features single-token LP, customizable price curves, and smart routing across DODO pools.

## Category
dex | Chains: Ethereum, BSC

## Key Operations
- **swap**: Swap tokens via DODO V2 Proxy with pair-based routing

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/protocols/dodo";
```

## SauceScript Examples

### swap
```typescript
import { DODOV2ProxyABI as IDODOProxy } from "./abis";

function main(proxyAddress: Address, fromToken: Address, toToken: Address, fromAmount: Uint256, minReturn: Uint256, dodoPairs: Tuple, direction: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const proxy = IDODOProxy.at(proxyAddress);
  return proxy.dodoSwapV2TokenToToken(fromToken, toToken, fromAmount, minReturn, dodoPairs, direction, false, 99999999999);
}
```
- `proxyAddress`: DODO V2 Proxy address for the target chain
- `fromToken`: Input token address
- `toToken`: Output token address
- `fromAmount`: Exact input amount (in wei)
- `minReturn`: Minimum output for slippage protection
- `dodoPairs`: Array of DODO pool addresses to route through (ordered for the swap path)
- `direction`: Bitmask encoding which side of each pool to use. Each bit represents a pool: `0` = sell base token, `1` = sell quote token. For a single pool, use `0` or `1`. For multi-pool, combine bits (e.g., `0b01` = first pool sell quote, second pool sell base)
- `isIncentive`: Set to `false` (incentive mining flag, usually disabled)

## Key Addresses
| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Ethereum | V2 Proxy | `0xa356867fDCeA8e71AEaf87805808803806231FDc` |
| BSC | V2 Proxy | `0x8F8Dd7DB1bDA5eD3da8C9dAf3bFA471c12d58486` |

## ABI Methods

### DODOV2ProxyABI
- `dodoSwapV2TokenToToken(address fromToken, address toToken, uint256 fromTokenAmount, uint256 minReturnAmount, address[] dodoPairs, uint256 directions, bool isIncentive, uint256 deadLine) -> uint256 returnAmount` - Execute a token-to-token swap through one or more DODO pools

## Notes
- PMM (Proactive Market Maker) provides better capital efficiency than constant product by concentrating liquidity near oracle price
- `dodoPairs` is an array of DODO pool addresses defining the swap route (each pool has a base token and a quote token)
- `directions` is a bitmask: for each pool in the path, a bit value of `0` means "sell base token" and `1` means "sell quote token". The least significant bit corresponds to the first pool
- For a single-pool swap: if you're selling the base token of that pool, `directions = 0`; if selling the quote token, `directions = 1`
- `isIncentive`: Flag for DODO mining incentives, typically set to `false`
- Pool discovery requires off-chain lookup via DODO's API or subgraph to find the right pool addresses
- Input token must be ERC20-approved to the V2 Proxy contract
- DODO also supports single-token LP (provide only one side of liquidity) which is unique among AMMs
