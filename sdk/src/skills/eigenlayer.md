# EigenLayer

Restaking protocol that enables staked ETH to secure additional protocols (AVS). Deposit LSTs into strategies to earn restaking rewards on top of staking yield.

## Category
restaking | Chains: Ethereum

## Key Operations
- **depositIntoStrategy**: Deposit LSTs (stETH, rETH, cbETH) into a restaking strategy
- **delegateTo**: Delegate restaked assets to an operator (via DelegationManager)
- **undelegate**: Undelegate from an operator, initiating withdrawal

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/protocols/eigenlayer";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Deposit LST into restaking strategy
import { StrategyManagerABI as IStrategyManager } from "./abis";
function main(strategyManagerAddress: Address, strategy: Address, token: Address, amount: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const sm = IStrategyManager.at(strategyManagerAddress);
  return sm.depositIntoStrategy(strategy, token, amount);
}
```

| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|

## ABI Methods
### StrategyManagerABI
- `depositIntoStrategy(address,address,uint256)` - Deposit token into strategy. Params: strategy address, token address, amount. Returns shares
- `stakerStrategyShares(address,address)` - Query staker's shares in a strategy

### DelegationManagerABI
- `delegateTo(address,tuple,bytes32)` - Delegate to operator. Tuple is (signature bytes, expiry uint256). Use empty sig + max expiry
- `undelegate(address)` - Undelegate staker. Returns withdrawal root bytes32[]
- `isDelegated(address)` - Check if address is delegated to an operator

### StrategyABI
- `sharesToUnderlyingView(uint256)` - Convert shares to underlying token amount
- `underlyingToSharesView(uint256)` - Convert underlying amount to shares

## Notes
- TVL: $13B+. Foundation of the restaking ecosystem
- Approve LST token to StrategyManager before depositing
- Each LST has its own strategy contract (stETH, rETH, cbETH listed above)
- Withdrawal has a 7-day delay period after undelegating
- delegateTo requires approverSignatureAndExpiry tuple - use empty bytes + far-future expiry for typical cases
