## SauceScript Functions

### deposit
Deposit assets into an EVault. Returns shares representing the deposit.
```typescript
import { EVaultABI as IEVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, amount: Uint256, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IEVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.deposit(amount, receiver);
}
```
- `vaultAddress`: Specific EVault address (each vault has its own asset and risk params)
- `receiver`: Address that receives the vault shares
- Returns the number of shares minted
- Requires ERC-20 approval of the underlying asset to the vault

### withdraw
Withdraw assets from an EVault by specifying underlying amount.
```typescript
import { EVaultABI as IEVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, amount: Uint256, receiver: Address, owner: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IEVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.withdraw(amount, receiver, owner);
}
```
- `owner`: Address whose shares are burned (must be msg.sender or have allowance)
- Returns the number of shares burned

### borrow
Borrow assets from an EVault. Must have collateral enabled via EVC first.
```typescript
import { EVaultABI as IEVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, amount: Uint256, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IEVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.borrow(amount, receiver);
}
```
- Must enable collateral and controller on EVC before borrowing
- Returns the number of debt shares created

### repay
Repay borrowed assets to reduce debt.
```typescript
import { EVaultABI as IEVault } from "./abis";

function main(vaultAddress: Address, amount: Uint256, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IEVault.at(vaultAddress);
  return vault.repay(amount, receiver);
}
```
- `receiver`: Address whose debt is being repaid
- Requires ERC-20 approval of the underlying to the vault
- Returns the number of debt shares burned

## ABI Reference

### EVaultABI
- `deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) returns (uint256 shares)` - Deposit underlying, receive vault shares
- `withdraw(uint256 amount, address receiver, address owner) returns (uint256 shares)` - Withdraw underlying by amount
- `borrow(uint256 amount, address receiver) returns (uint256 shares)` - Borrow underlying tokens
- `repay(uint256 amount, address receiver) returns (uint256 shares)` - Repay borrowed debt
- `redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) returns (uint256 amount)` - Redeem vault shares for underlying

### EVCABI
- `enableCollateral(address account, address vault)` - Enable an EVault as collateral for an account
- `enableController(address account, address vault)` - Enable an EVault as debt controller for an account

## Notes
- ERC-4626 compatible vault interface (deposit/withdraw/redeem)
- Must call `EVC.enableCollateral(account, collateralVault)` AND `EVC.enableController(account, borrowVault)` before borrowing
- Each EVault is a separate market with its own underlying asset and risk parameters
- Vaults are permissionlessly created -- always verify vault parameters before depositing
- Rebuilt from scratch after V1 exploit -- new architecture based on EVC
- TVL: $1B+. Audited
