# GMX V2

Next generation of GMX perpetual exchange with isolated markets, improved risk management, and GM liquidity tokens replacing GLP.

## Category
perpetuals | Chains: Arbitrum

## Key Operations
- **createOrder**: Create a market/limit order for trading (complex tuple params)
- **sendTokens**: Send tokens via ExchangeRouter (used before creating orders)
- **cancelOrder**: Cancel a pending order by key

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/protocols/gmx-v2";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Create a market order
import { ExchangeRouterABI as IExchangeRouter } from "./abis";
function main(
  exchangeRouterAddress: Address, receiver: Address, cancellationReceiver: Address,
  market: Address, initialCollateralToken: Address, sizeDeltaUsd: Uint256,
  initialCollateralDeltaAmount: Uint256, triggerPrice: Uint256, acceptablePrice: Uint256,
  executionFee: Uint256, minOutputAmount: Uint256, orderType: Uint256, isLong: Bool
): Uint256 {
  const router = IExchangeRouter.at(exchangeRouterAddress);
  const result = router.createOrder({
    addresses: {
      receiver: receiver, cancellationReceiver: cancellationReceiver,
      callbackContract: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      uiFeeReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      market: market, initialCollateralToken: initialCollateralToken, swapPath: []
    },
    numbers: {
      sizeDeltaUsd: sizeDeltaUsd, initialCollateralDeltaAmount: initialCollateralDeltaAmount,
      triggerPrice: triggerPrice, acceptablePrice: acceptablePrice,
      executionFee: executionFee, callbackGasLimit: 0, minOutputAmount: minOutputAmount
    },
    orderType: orderType, decreasePositionSwapType: 0,
    isLong: isLong, shouldUnwrapNativeToken: false, autoCancel: false,
    referralCode: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  });
  return result;
}

// Send tokens to market vault before creating order
import { ExchangeRouterABI as IExchangeRouter } from "./abis";
function main(exchangeRouterAddress: Address, token: Address, receiver: Address, amount: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const router = IExchangeRouter.at(exchangeRouterAddress);
  router.sendTokens(token, receiver, amount);
  return 1;
}

// Cancel pending order
import { ExchangeRouterABI as IExchangeRouter } from "./abis";
function main(exchangeRouterAddress: Address, orderKey: Bytes32): Uint256 {
  const router = IExchangeRouter.at(exchangeRouterAddress);
  router.cancelOrder(orderKey);
  return 1;
}
```

## Key Addresses
| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Arbitrum | exchangeRouter | `0x7C68C7866A64FA2160F78EEaE12217FFbf871fa8` |
| Arbitrum | dataStore | `0xFD70de6b91282D8017aA4E741e9Ae325CAb992d8` |

## ABI Methods
### ExchangeRouterABI
- `createOrder(tuple)` - Create order. Returns order key (bytes32). See CreateOrderParams struct below
- `cancelOrder(bytes32)` - Cancel pending order by key
- `sendTokens(address,address,uint256)` - Send tokens to vault. Must be called before createOrder

### CreateOrderParams Struct
- **addresses**: { receiver, cancellationReceiver, callbackContract, uiFeeReceiver, market, initialCollateralToken, swapPath[] }
- **numbers**: { sizeDeltaUsd, initialCollateralDeltaAmount, triggerPrice, acceptablePrice, executionFee, callbackGasLimit, minOutputAmount }
- **orderType**: 0=MarketSwap, 1=LimitSwap, 2=MarketIncrease, 3=LimitIncrease, 4=MarketDecrease, 5=LimitDecrease, 6=StopLossDecrease
- **isLong**: true for long, false for short

## Notes
- TVL: $800M+. Isolated markets with separate GM tokens per trading pair
- Order flow: 1) sendTokens to market vault, 2) createOrder with execution fee
- executionFee is paid in ETH (msg.value) to cover keeper gas costs
- sizeDeltaUsd is in USD with 30 decimals (1 USD = 1e30)
- Each market has its own address - query dataStore for market info
