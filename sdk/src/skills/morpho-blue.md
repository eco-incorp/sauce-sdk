# Morpho Blue

Minimal and gas-efficient lending primitive with permissionless market creation. Markets are defined by a unique (loanToken, collateralToken, oracle, IRM, LLTV) tuple.

## Category
lending | Chains: Ethereum (1), Base (8453)

## SauceScript Functions

### supply
Supply loan tokens to a specific market. Earns interest from borrowers.
```typescript
import { MorphoABI as IMorpho } from "./abis";

function main(morphoAddress: Address, loanToken: Address, collateralToken: Address, oracle: Address, irm: Address, lltv: Uint256, amount: Uint256, onBehalf: Address): Uint256 {
  const morpho = IMorpho.at(morphoAddress);
  morpho.supply({loanToken: loanToken, collateralToken: collateralToken, oracle: oracle, irm: irm, lltv: lltv}, amount, 0, onBehalf, 0x00);
  return 1;
}
```
- All 5 marketParams fields (loanToken, collateralToken, oracle, irm, lltv) identify the market
- `amount`: Supply by assets (set shares param to 0)
- `onBehalf`: Address that receives the supply position
- `data`: Callback data, use `0x00` for no callback
- Requires ERC-20 approval of loanToken to the Morpho address

### withdraw
Withdraw supplied loan tokens from a market.
```typescript
import { MorphoABI as IMorpho } from "./abis";

function main(morphoAddress: Address, loanToken: Address, collateralToken: Address, oracle: Address, irm: Address, lltv: Uint256, amount: Uint256, onBehalf: Address, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const morpho = IMorpho.at(morphoAddress);
  morpho.withdraw({loanToken: loanToken, collateralToken: collateralToken, oracle: oracle, irm: irm, lltv: lltv}, amount, 0, onBehalf, receiver);
  return 1;
}
```
- `receiver`: Address that receives the withdrawn tokens

### borrow
Borrow loan tokens against supplied collateral.
```typescript
import { MorphoABI as IMorpho } from "./abis";

function main(morphoAddress: Address, loanToken: Address, collateralToken: Address, oracle: Address, irm: Address, lltv: Uint256, amount: Uint256, onBehalf: Address, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const morpho = IMorpho.at(morphoAddress);
  morpho.borrow({loanToken: loanToken, collateralToken: collateralToken, oracle: oracle, irm: irm, lltv: lltv}, amount, 0, onBehalf, receiver);
  return 1;
}
```
- Must have sufficient collateral supplied via `supplyCollateral` first

### repay
Repay borrowed loan tokens.
```typescript
import { MorphoABI as IMorpho } from "./abis";

function main(morphoAddress: Address, loanToken: Address, collateralToken: Address, oracle: Address, irm: Address, lltv: Uint256, amount: Uint256, onBehalf: Address): Uint256 {
  const morpho = IMorpho.at(morphoAddress);
  morpho.repay({loanToken: loanToken, collateralToken: collateralToken, oracle: oracle, irm: irm, lltv: lltv}, amount, 0, onBehalf, 0x00);
  return 1;
}
```
- Requires ERC-20 approval of loanToken to the Morpho address

## ABI Reference

### MorphoABI
- `supply(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, bytes data) returns (uint256 assetsSupplied, uint256 sharesSupplied)` - Supply loan tokens (specify assets OR shares, set other to 0)
- `withdraw(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, address receiver) returns (uint256 assetsWithdrawn, uint256 sharesWithdrawn)` - Withdraw loan tokens
- `borrow(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, address receiver) returns (uint256 assetsBorrowed, uint256 sharesBorrowed)` - Borrow loan tokens
- `repay(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, bytes data) returns (uint256 assetsRepaid, uint256 sharesRepaid)` - Repay borrowed debt
- `supplyCollateral(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, address onBehalf, bytes data)` - Supply collateral tokens (required before borrowing)
- `withdrawCollateral(MarketParams marketParams, uint256 assets, address onBehalf, address receiver)` - Withdraw collateral tokens

MarketParams tuple: `(address loanToken, address collateralToken, address oracle, address irm, uint256 lltv)`

## Notes
- Markets are identified by the full marketParams tuple, not an address or ID
- Pass amount in `assets` param and set `shares` to 0 for standard operations
- Each market is fully isolated -- no cross-market risk contagion
- `lltv` is the Liquidation Loan-to-Value ratio (e.g. 86% = 860000000000000000)
- Supply collateral is separate from supplying loan tokens -- collateral does not earn interest
- Bundler3 contract allows batching multiple Morpho operations in a single transaction
- Same Morpho address on both Ethereum and Base
- TVL: $6B+. Audited
