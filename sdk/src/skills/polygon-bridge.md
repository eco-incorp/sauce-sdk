# Polygon Native Bridge

Official Polygon PoS bridge via RootChainManager. Supports ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 deposits with checkpoint-based withdrawals.

## Category
native L2 bridge | Direction: L1 to L2 (Ethereum to Polygon) | Chains: Ethereum (1), Polygon (137)

## SauceScript Functions

### depositETH
Deposit ETH from Ethereum to Polygon (received as WETH on Polygon).
```typescript
import { PolygonRootChainManagerABI as IRootChainManager } from "./abis";

function main(rootChainManagerAddress: Address, recipient: Address): Uint256 {
  const manager = IRootChainManager.at(rootChainManagerAddress);
  return manager.depositEtherFor(recipient);
}
```
- `recipient`: Address to receive WETH on Polygon
- ETH amount is sent as `msg.value`
- ETH is received as WETH on Polygon (Polygon uses WMATIC as native token)

### depositERC20
Deposit ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.
```typescript
import { PolygonRootChainManagerABI as IRootChainManager } from "./abis";

function main(rootChainManagerAddress: Address, recipient: Address, rootToken: Address, depositData: Bytes): Uint256 {
  const manager = IRootChainManager.at(rootChainManagerAddress);
  return manager.depositFor(recipient, rootToken, depositData);
}
```
- `recipient`: Address to receive tokens on Polygon
- `rootToken`: L1 (Ethereum) ERC-20 token address
- `depositData`: ABI-encoded amount as bytes. Encode via `abi.encode(uint256 amount)`
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the **ERC20Predicate** contract (NOT the RootChainManager)

## ABI Reference

### PolygonRootChainManagerABI
- `depositEtherFor(address user)` [payable] - Deposit ETH to Polygon for a specified user. Received as WETH
- `depositFor(address user, address rootToken, bytes depositData)` - Deposit ERC-20 tokens to Polygon. `depositData` = ABI-encoded amount
- `exit(bytes inputData)` - Process a withdrawal on L1 using a burn proof from Polygon (checkpoint-based)

## Notes
- **L1 to L2** deposits via RootChainManager. **L2 to L1** withdrawals require burning tokens on Polygon, then calling `exit()` on L1 with the burn proof
- **Approval target for ERC-20**: approve tokens to the **ERC20Predicate** (`0x40ec5B...`), NOT the RootChainManager
- `depositData` for ERC-20 is `abi.encode(amount)` -- the amount encoded as a 32-byte uint256
- ETH deposits are received as WETH on Polygon (Polygon's native token is MATIC)
- L1 to L2 deposits finalize after the next Polygon checkpoint (~30-60 minutes)
- L2 to L1 withdrawals require checkpoint inclusion + `exit()` call on Ethereum (~3 hours for checkpoint)
- Supports ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 via different predicate contracts
- Canonical bridge -- no third-party risk, secured by the Polygon PoS validator set
- Audited
