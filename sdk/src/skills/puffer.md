# Puffer Finance

Liquid restaking protocol that issues pufETH via an ERC-4626 vault. Deposits are natively restaked via EigenLayer for additional yield.

## Category
restaking | Chains: Ethereum

## Key Operations
- **deposit**: Deposit assets into PufferVault, receive pufETH shares
- **redeem**: Redeem pufETH shares for underlying assets

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/protocols/puffer";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Deposit into PufferVault
import { PufferVaultABI as IPufferVault } from "./abis";
function main(pufferVaultAddress: Address, assets: Uint256, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IPufferVault.at(pufferVaultAddress);
  return vault.deposit(assets, receiver);
}

// Redeem pufETH shares
import { PufferVaultABI as IPufferVault } from "./abis";
function main(pufferVaultAddress: Address, shares: Uint256, receiver: Address, owner: Address): Uint256 {
  const vault = IPufferVault.at(pufferVaultAddress);
  return vault.redeem(shares, receiver, owner);
}
```

## Key Addresses
| Chain | Contract | Address |

## ABI Methods
### PufferVaultABI (ERC-4626)
- `deposit(uint256,address)` - Deposit assets, receive pufETH shares. Returns shares minted
- `redeem(uint256,address,address)` - Redeem shares for assets. Params: shares, receiver, owner
- `convertToShares(uint256)` - Preview shares for asset amount
- `convertToAssets(uint256)` - Preview assets for share amount
- `balanceOf(address)` - Query pufETH balance

## Notes
- TVL: $62M+. ERC-4626 vault interface (same as Yearn V3, sfrxETH, sDAI)
- pufETH is non-rebasing - exchange rate increases over time
- Natively restaked on EigenLayer
- Standard ERC-4626 deposit/redeem pattern
