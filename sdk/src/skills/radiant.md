# Radiant

Omnichain lending protocol on Arbitrum. Aave V2 fork with cross-chain lending capabilities via LayerZero. Requires dLP locking for emission eligibility.

## SauceScript Functions

### deposit
Deposit assets to earn interest and receive rTokens.
```typescript
import { RadiantLendingPoolABI as IRadiantLendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IRadiantLendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  pool.deposit(asset, amount, onBehalfOf, 0);
  return 1;
}
```
- `onBehalfOf`: Address that receives rTokens (use msg.sender for self)
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the LendingPool

### withdraw
Withdraw deposited assets by burning rTokens.
```typescript
import { RadiantLendingPoolABI as IRadiantLendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, to: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IRadiantLendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  return pool.withdraw(asset, amount, to);
}
```
- `amount`: Use `type(uint256).max` to withdraw all
- Returns actual withdrawn amount

### borrow
Borrow assets against deposited collateral.
```typescript
import { RadiantLendingPoolABI as IRadiantLendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, interestRateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IRadiantLendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  pool.borrow(asset, amount, interestRateMode, 0, onBehalfOf);
  return 1;
}
```
- `interestRateMode`: 1 = stable, 2 = variable

### repay
Repay borrowed debt.
```typescript
import { RadiantLendingPoolABI as IRadiantLendingPool } from "./abis";

function main(lendingPoolAddress: Address, asset: Address, amount: Uint256, rateMode: Uint256, onBehalfOf: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IRadiantLendingPool.at(lendingPoolAddress);
  return pool.repay(asset, amount, rateMode, onBehalfOf);
}
```
- `rateMode`: Must match existing debt type (1 = stable, 2 = variable)
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the LendingPool

## ABI Reference

### RadiantLendingPoolABI
- `deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)` - Deposit asset to earn interest
- `withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) returns (uint256)` - Withdraw deposited asset
- `borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf)` - Borrow against collateral
- `repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 rateMode, address onBehalfOf) returns (uint256)` - Repay borrowed debt

## Notes
- Same interface as Aave V2 (forked codebase) -- referralCode always 0
- Requires dLP (dynamic liquidity provision) locking to be eligible for RDNT emissions
- Users must lock at least 5% of deposit value in dLP to earn platform fees
- interestRateMode: 1 = stable, 2 = variable
- All deposit/repay operations require ERC-20 approval to LendingPool
- Arbitrum-only deployment. TVL: $100M+. Audited
