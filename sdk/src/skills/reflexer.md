# Reflexer

Non-pegged stablecoin protocol issuing RAI. Uses a PID controller to dampen RAI price volatility against ETH collateral.

## Category
cdp | Chains: Ethereum

## Key Operations
- **exitRai**: Exit RAI from the system (withdraw RAI tokens)
- **joinRai**: Join RAI into the system (deposit RAI tokens)

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco/sauce-sdk/protocols/reflexer";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Exit RAI from system
import { CoinJoinABI as ICoinJoin } from "./abis";
function main(coinJoinAddress: Address, account: Address, amount: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const coinJoin = ICoinJoin.at(coinJoinAddress);
  coinJoin.exit(account, amount);
  return 1;
}

// Join RAI into system
import { CoinJoinABI as ICoinJoin } from "./abis";
function main(coinJoinAddress: Address, account: Address, amount: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const coinJoin = ICoinJoin.at(coinJoinAddress);
  coinJoin.join(account, amount);
  return 1;
}
```

| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Ethereum | rai | `0x03ab458634910AaD20eF5f1C8ee96F1D6ac54919` |

## ABI Methods
### SAFEEngineABI
- `modifySAFECollateralization(bytes32,address,address,address,int256,int256)` - Modify SAFE position. Params: collateralType (bytes32 identifier), safe (SAFE owner), collateralSource, debtDestination, deltaCollateral (positive=add, negative=remove), deltaDebt (positive=borrow, negative=repay)
- `safes(bytes32,address)` - Query SAFE position. Params: collateralType, safe address. Returns (lockedCollateral, generatedDebt)

### CoinJoinABI
- `join(address,uint256)` - Join RAI into system (deposit). Params: account, wad (RAI amount, 18 decimals)
- `exit(address,uint256)` - Exit RAI from system (withdraw). Params: account, wad

### ETHJoinABI
- `join(address)` - Join ETH as collateral. Payable (send ETH). Params: account
- `exit(address,uint256)` - Exit ETH collateral. Params: account, wad (ETH amount)

## Notes
- RAI is non-pegged, floating around $3 - NOT a $1 stablecoin
- PID controller adjusts the redemption rate to dampen RAI price volatility
- Inspired by MakerDAO but with a non-pegged design philosophy
- SAFEs (similar to MakerDAO Vaults) hold ETH collateral backing RAI debt
- coinJoin converts between internal system debt units and external RAI ERC-20
- ethJoin converts between ETH and internal collateral accounting
