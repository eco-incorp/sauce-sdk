# Scroll Native Bridge

Official Scroll zkEVM bridge via L1ScrollMessenger and L1GatewayRouter. Deposits ETH and ERC-20 tokens with ZK proof-based finality.

## Category
native L2 bridge | Direction: L1 to L2 (Ethereum to Scroll) | Chains: Ethereum (1), Scroll (534352)

## SauceScript Functions

### depositETH
Deposit ETH from Ethereum L1 to Scroll L2.
```typescript
import { ScrollL1GatewayRouterABI as IL1GatewayRouter } from "./abis";

function main(gatewayRouterAddress: Address, amount: Uint256, gasLimit: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const router = IL1GatewayRouter.at(gatewayRouterAddress);
  return router.depositETH(amount, gasLimit);
}
```
- `amount`: Amount of ETH to deposit (also send as `msg.value`)
- `gasLimit`: L2 gas limit for the deposit execution (e.g. 200000)
- Requires ETH as msg.value covering amount + L2 gas fees

### depositERC20
Deposit ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum L1 to Scroll L2.
```typescript
import { ScrollL1GatewayRouterABI as IL1GatewayRouter } from "./abis";

function main(gatewayRouterAddress: Address, token: Address, amount: Uint256, gasLimit: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const router = IL1GatewayRouter.at(gatewayRouterAddress);
  return router.depositERC20(token, amount, gasLimit);
}
```
- `token`: L1 ERC-20 token address
- `amount`: Amount of tokens to deposit
- `gasLimit`: L2 gas limit for the deposit execution (e.g. 200000)
- Requires ERC-20 approval to the L1GatewayRouter
- Requires ETH as msg.value for L2 gas fees

## ABI Reference

### ScrollL1GatewayRouterABI
- `depositETH(uint256 _amount, uint256 _gasLimit)` [payable] - Deposit ETH to your own address on Scroll
- `depositERC20(address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _gasLimit)` [payable] - Deposit ERC-20 tokens to your own address on Scroll

### ScrollL1MessengerABI
- `sendMessage(address to, uint256 value, bytes message, uint256 gasLimit)` [payable] - Send arbitrary message from L1 to L2 (low-level messaging)

## Notes
- **L1 to L2** via GatewayRouter (for token deposits) or L1ScrollMessenger (for arbitrary messages)
- zkEVM architecture -- withdrawals finalize with ZK proofs (faster than optimistic rollups, typically hours not days)
- GatewayRouter auto-routes tokens to the correct gateway (standard ERC-20, WETH, custom gateways)
- `msg.value` must include gas fees for L2 execution (even for ERC-20 deposits)
- L1 to L2 deposits finalize after ZK proof generation (~1-4 hours)
- L2 to L1 withdrawals also require ZK proof finalization (~1-4 hours)
- Canonical bridge -- no third-party risk, secured by Scroll's ZK proving system
- Audited
