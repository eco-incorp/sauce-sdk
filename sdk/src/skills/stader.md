# Stader

Multi-chain liquid staking protocol. ETHx is Stader's non-rebasing liquid staking token for Ethereum.

## Category
liquid-staking | Chains: Ethereum

## Key Operations
- **deposit**: Stake ETH to receive ETHx

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco/sauce-sdk/protocols/stader";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Stake ETH for ETHx
import { StakePoolManagerABI as IStakePoolManager } from "./abis";
function main(stakePoolManagerAddress: Address, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const pool = IStakePoolManager.at(stakePoolManagerAddress);
  return pool.deposit(receiver);
}
```

## Key Addresses
| Chain | Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Ethereum | ETHx | `0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b` |
| Ethereum | stakePoolManager | `0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299` |

## ABI Methods
### StakePoolManagerABI
- `deposit(address)` - Stake ETH (payable), receive ETHx. Param: receiver address. Returns ETHx amount
- `getExchangeRate()` - Current ETHx/ETH exchange rate

### ETHxABI
- `balanceOf(address)` - Query ETHx balance
- `approve(address,uint256)` - Approve ETHx spending

## Notes
- TVL: $300M+. ETHx is non-rebasing (value accrues over time)
- deposit() is payable - send ETH as msg.value, pass receiver address
- Compatible with EigenLayer restaking (can deposit into stETH/ETHx strategies)
