# Superfluid

Protocol for real-time finance enabling continuous token streams (per-second payments), distributions, and composable Super Tokens.

## Category
payments | Chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base

## Key Operations
- **createFlow**: Create a continuous payment stream
- **updateFlow**: Update the flow rate of an existing stream
- **deleteFlow**: Stop/delete a payment stream

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/protocols/superfluid";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Create payment stream
import { CFAForwarderABI as ICFAForwarder } from "./abis";
function main(forwarderAddress: Address, token: Address, sender: Address, receiver: Address, flowrate: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const forwarder = ICFAForwarder.at(forwarderAddress);
  forwarder.createFlow(token, sender, receiver, flowrate, 0x00);
  return 1;
}

// Update flow rate
import { CFAForwarderABI as ICFAForwarder } from "./abis";
function main(forwarderAddress: Address, token: Address, sender: Address, receiver: Address, flowrate: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const forwarder = ICFAForwarder.at(forwarderAddress);
  forwarder.updateFlow(token, sender, receiver, flowrate, 0x00);
  return 1;
}

// Delete payment stream
import { CFAForwarderABI as ICFAForwarder } from "./abis";
function main(forwarderAddress: Address, token: Address, sender: Address, receiver: Address): Uint256 {
  const forwarder = ICFAForwarder.at(forwarderAddress);
  forwarder.deleteFlow(token, sender, receiver, 0x00);
  return 1;
}
```

## ABI Methods
### CFAForwarderABI
- `createFlow(address,address,address,int96,bytes)` - Create stream. Params: token (Super Token), sender, receiver, flowrate (tokens per second as int96), userData (arbitrary bytes, 0x00 for none). Returns bool
- `updateFlow(address,address,address,int96,bytes)` - Update flow rate. Params: token, sender, receiver, flowrate (new rate), userData. Returns bool
- `deleteFlow(address,address,address,bytes)` - Delete stream. Params: token, sender, receiver, userData. Returns bool

## Notes
- Flowrate is in tokens per second (int96) - e.g. 1e18 / (30 * 86400) for ~1 token/month
- Uses Super Tokens - wrapped ERC-20s with streaming capability (wrap before streaming)
- Same host and cfaForwarder addresses on all 5 chains
- CFAForwarder is the simplified interface; host is the core protocol contract
- Streams are continuous - balance updates every second without transactions
- Sender must maintain sufficient Super Token balance; otherwise stream gets liquidated
- userData allows passing arbitrary data for composability with other contracts
