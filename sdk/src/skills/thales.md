- **buyFromAMM**: Buy positional tokens (UP/DOWN) from the Thales AMM
- **createSpeedMarket**: Create a speed market position

## SDK Usage
```typescript
import { protocolInfo, deployments, sauceFunctions } from "@eco/sauce-sdk/protocols/thales";
```

## SauceScript Examples
```typescript
// Buy from AMM
import { ThalesAMMABI as IThalesAMM } from "./abis";
function main(thalesAMMAddress: Address, market: Address, position: Uint256, amount: Uint256, expectedPayout: Uint256, slippage: Uint256): Uint256 {
  const amm = IThalesAMM.at(thalesAMMAddress);
  amm.buyFromAMM(market, position, amount, expectedPayout, slippage);
  return 1;
}

// Exercise matured market
import { ThalesAMMABI as IThalesAMM } from "./abis";
function main(thalesAMMAddress: Address, market: Address): Uint256 {
  const amm = IThalesAMM.at(thalesAMMAddress);
  amm.exerciseMaturedMarket(market);
  return 1;
}
```

| Chain | Contract | Address |

## ABI Methods
### ThalesAMMABI
- `buyFromAMM(address,uint8,uint256,uint256,uint256)` - Buy positional tokens. Params: market (market address), position (0=UP, 1=DOWN), amount (tokens to buy), expectedPayout (expected return), additionalSlippage (slippage tolerance)
- `exerciseMaturedMarket(address)` - Exercise matured position. Params: market (address of matured market)

### SpeedMarketsAMMABI
- `createNewMarket(bytes32,uint64,uint8,address,uint256,address)` - Create speed market. Params: asset (bytes32 identifier), strikeTime (expiry timestamp), direction (0=UP, 1=DOWN), collateral (payment token), buyinAmount (amount to bet), referrer

## Notes
- Position 0 = UP (price goes up), Position 1 = DOWN (price goes down)
- Markets expire at set times - exercise only after maturation
- Speed markets have short durations (minutes to hours)
- Binary outcome: winning position gets payout, losing gets nothing
- Approve sUSD/USDC to thalesAMM before buying
