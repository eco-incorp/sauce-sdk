/**
 * AlphaQ — a "quant" multi-market Solana AMM with NO on-chain IDL. Program id
 * `ALPHAQmeA7bjrVuccPsYPiCvsi428SNwte66Srvs4pHA`, Jupiter label `"AlphaQ"`
 * (`benchmark/adapters/fixtures/jupiter-program-id-to-label.json`), $218.8M/7d
 * $40.5M/24h per the Jupiter volume snapshot this integration was scoped from.
 *
 * REVERSE-ENGINEERED FROM MAINNET (no IDL, no docs) via:
 *   1. `getProgramAccounts` (owner=program id) split by `dataSize` — every
 *      market is a 672-byte "config" account (symbol/mints/vaults/decimals)
 *      paired 1:1 by a 16-byte leading ASCII symbol string with a 336-byte
 *      "stats" account (per-market hot state the swap CPI writes to; holds no
 *      pubkeys itself and does not derive from the market's address by any
 *      PDA / `create_address_with_seed` scheme we could find — see
 *      `ALPHAQ_STATS_ACCOUNTS` below).
 *   2. `getSignaturesForAddress` + `getTransaction` on a market account to
 *      isolate real historical swap CPIs (the program's OWN keeper also calls
 *      it directly with an unrelated, longer, per-market "crank"/oracle-update
 *      instruction — never confuse the two; only the CPI-nested one below is
 *      the swap).
 *   3. Jupiter's public `quote` + `swap-instructions` endpoints, replayed
 *      through `simulateTransaction` (sigVerify:false, replaceRecentBlockhash,
 *      innerInstructions:true) to recover the EXACT bytes of a FRESH,
 *      currently-valid swap CPI at several sizes and both directions — a
 *      byte-for-byte replay of a real HISTORICAL swap's instruction data
 *      reproducibly fails `InvalidInstructionData` at ~2,011 CU regardless of
 *      account permissions, CPI depth (tested via a purpose-built on-chain
 *      relay program) or payload content, so the format could only be pinned
 *      by observing FRESH instructions the chain still accepts, not by
 *      decoding a captured one. See "SWAP INSTRUCTION" below for the result.
 *   4. A same-technique account-permission bisection (via the same relay
 *      program) to find the one non-obvious flag: account #2 (the "stats"
 *      account) must ride WRITABLE or the CPI fails `Immutable` after both
 *      SPL transfers already ran.
 *
 * SWAP INSTRUCTION (opcode 0x0c) — 18 bytes total, CONFIRMED against the real
 * program via `simulateTransaction` at 4 sizes (10, 1,000, 5,000, 50,000,
 * 130,000 USDT) and both directions on the USDT-USDC market:
 *   `[0x0c, dirByte, amountIn: u64 LE, 0x00 * 8]`
 *   - dirByte = 1: mintA(vaultA) -> mintB(vaultB); dirByte = 0: reverse.
 *   - the trailing 8 bytes are always zero in every real sample gathered —
 *     no venue-level min_out; the recipe's own terminal outAta-delta check
 *     is the real floor, exactly the "venue min_out is always 1" doc on
 *     {@link LadderSwapTemplate} (here it's simply absent, not encoded as 1).
 *   - amountIn genuinely needs the full 8 bytes: confirmed via a
 *     130,000,000,000-raw-unit (130k USDT) trade whose encoded value exceeds
 *     u32 range and round-trips exactly as a u64 LE.
 *
 * ACCOUNTS (12, order load-bearing, CONFIRMED against Jupiter's real
 * swap-instructions accounts + a from-scratch replay via a purpose-built
 * on-chain CPI relay program — see the module doc above):
 *   0 owner            (signer)
 *   1 market            (672-byte config account; read-only)
 *   2 stats             (336-byte hot-state account; WRITABLE — the one
 *                         non-obvious flag; omitting it fails `Immutable`
 *                         after both transfers already landed)
 *   3 user source ATA   (writable)
 *   4 user dest ATA     (writable)
 *   5 vaultA            (writable)
 *   6 vaultB            (writable)
 *   7 vaultA            (dup, read-only)
 *   8 vaultB            (dup, read-only)
 *   9 vaultB            (dup, writable — the observed "fee" leg; always
 *                         vaultB regardless of trade direction in every
 *                         sample gathered)
 *  10 token program (Tokenkeg)
 *  11 instructions sysvar
 *
 * MARKET ACCOUNT (672 bytes) layout actually used here (every offset
 * ground-truthed against >=40 real mainnet market accounts via gPA, matched
 * to known mint addresses and real SPL vault balances/decimals):
 *   [0:16)    ASCII symbol, e.g. "USDT-USDC", NUL-padded (also the stats
 *             account's own leading 16 bytes — the ONLY join key available;
 *             see ALPHAQ_STATS_ACCOUNTS)
 *   [106]     decimalsA (u8)
 *   [107]     decimalsB (u8)
 *   [112:144) vaultA (SPL token account holding mintA; matches offset 176
 *             verbatim in every sample — a duplicated field, harmless)
 *   [144:176) vaultB (ditto, duplicated at 208 and 304)
 *   [240:272) mintA
 *   [272:304) mintB
 * Fields outside this list (a keeper/admin pubkey at [24:56), several
 * slot/timestamp u32s, and a large unread block from [336:672) that almost
 * certainly holds AlphaQ's REAL virtual-liquidity / curve state) are not
 * decoded — see "QUOTE MODEL" for why they are not needed here.
 *
 * QUOTE MODEL — DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE, NOT AlphaQ's real curve, AND
 * SCOPE-LIMITED to genuine $1-stablecoin pairs (see STABLE_MINTS below).
 * Real quotes gathered live (USDT-USDC, `onlyDirectRoutes=true` so
 * single-market): 5,000 USDT -> 4995.696234 USDC (-8.6bps), 50,000 ->
 * 49942.058920 (-11.6bps), 130,000 -> 129625.077569 (-28.8bps). Back-solving
 * a constant-product (x*y=k) curve from those points gives an EFFECTIVE
 * depth of ~46.19M raw-unit tokens each side — roughly 300x the market's
 * REAL SPL vault balances (~150k USDT / ~290k USDC at capture time) — i.e.
 * AlphaQ is NOT pricing off its own vault balances; it has some deeper
 * backing (a shared multi-market hub, an oracle, or both) this integration
 * could not fully identify from the outside.
 *
 * REJECTED FIRST ATTEMPT (kept here as a citable mistake, not a footnote):
 * an earlier revision of this file priced directly off the raw vaultA/
 * vaultB SPL balances as a plain constant-product pair (reserveIn,
 * reserveOut) = (vaultA, vaultB). That is WRONG, not just imprecise — this
 * market's vaults are frequently skewed (observed ~2.15:1 USDC:USDT at one
 * capture), and a plain CP formula's SPOT PRICE *is* reserveOut/reserveIn,
 * so it would have quoted ~2.15 USDC per 1 USDT — a gross, FAVOURABLE
 * mispricing of the base exchange rate itself (not merely the slippage
 * curve), caught by this file's own offline test
 * (test/fast/alphaq.quote.test.ts) asserting predicted <= real against a
 * freshly re-fetched fixture. The fix below never derives the spot price
 * from the raw reserve ratio.
 *
 * THE ACTUAL MODEL: assumes near-1:1 fair value between mintA and mintB
 * (true for a genuine stablecoin pair, false for an LST/SOL or wrapped-BTC
 * pair) and prices a SYMMETRIC constant-product curve `out = net * D /
 * (D + net)` where `D = min(rawVaultA, rawVaultB)` (raw units — see the gate
 * below requiring decimalsA === decimalsB, which makes raw-unit comparison
 * directly meaningful) and `net = x - ceil(x * 10bps)`. Spot price is
 * therefore pinned at parity (minus the haircut), never at the skewed raw
 * ratio; depth is bounded by the THINNER real vault, which is real,
 * verifiable, on-chain state — this UNDERSTATES AlphaQ's real (~300x
 * deeper) depth on every market checked, the safe direction. Monotone +
 * concave by construction (a standard CP curve). The real on-chain CPI
 * still executes AlphaQ's OWN pricing regardless of this model's accuracy
 * — this curve only shapes OFF-CHAIN election/sizing; the recipe's
 * post-swap outAta-delta check is what actually bounds the fill.
 *
 * SCOPE GATE: this model is only SAFE for pairs both sides of which are
 * genuine ~$1 stablecoins — for an LST-SOL or wrapped-BTC market (also
 * present in AlphaQ's universe) the true fair rate is NOT 1:1, and assuming
 * parity could OVER-promise the appreciated side (e.g. paying 1 SOL for
 * jitoSOL at assumed parity would over-promise jitoSOL, since jitoSOL is
 * really worth MORE than SOL) — exactly the favourable-error hazard this
 * integration exists to avoid. `fetchAlphaqPoolConfig` therefore requires
 * BOTH mints to be in the curated `STABLE_MINTS` set below AND to share the
 * same on-chain decimals, self-dropping (throwing, caught by
 * `resolveSvmPoolSpec`) every other AlphaQ market rather than guessing at a
 * price this integration has no oracle to verify. That is a real, current
 * scope limitation (9 of AlphaQ's 40 markets, all $1-stablecoin pairs) —
 * not a refusal: extending to LST/BTC/RWA pairs needs an actual price
 * reference this integration does not have, not more reserve-reading.
 *
 * KNOWN OPEN ISSUE: the real-CPI LiteSVM cell for this family
 * (test/svm/ecoswap-svm.realcpi.e2e.test.ts's `alphaq quadrilateral`)
 * currently fails `InvalidAccountOwner` at ~5,010 CU inside AlphaQ's own
 * execution, DESPITE the identical account list/instruction format being
 * independently proven correct on REAL mainnet via two separate methods (a
 * from-scratch CPI relay program and Jupiter's own route) at 5 sizes and
 * both directions. See that test file's module doc for the full
 * investigation trail (what was ruled out and what remains untested) — this
 * is flagged as a follow-up, not resolved by guessing further.
