/**
 * Hadron (SvmRoute venue — no on-chain IDL, no public docs). Program
 * `HADRoNbLovyqhCsocfYQYB7QdfCAAinN9HTePvBCVDQ8` (Jupiter's own label-map
 * program id -> label, "Hadron"). Recovered entirely via live account reads
 * + real-transaction archaeology (`getSignaturesForAddress` +
 * `getTransaction`, ~6,000 recent signatures scanned, 97 real swap CPIs
 * found across 4 actively-traded pools) plus real `simulateTransaction`
 * probes (`sigVerify:false`) against the DEPLOYED program on real mainnet
 * state, 2026-07-31 — see ladder.ts's "QUOTE MODEL — evidence" section for
 * the measured numbers this file's registry comes from.
 *
 * ── SHAPE: ORACLE-ANCHORED INVENTORY (obric-style), NOT pool-resident CP ──
 * Every real pair account ("PAIR", 724 bytes, one per listed (mintA,mintB)
 * combination — 129 real PAIR accounts found via a full `getProgramAccounts`
 * dump) is priced from a PER-ASSET oracle field, not from its own two vault
 * balances: on the live jitoSOL/WSOL pool the raw vault ratio was
 * ~0.0657 WSOL-per-jitoSOL while every real/simulated swap executed at
 * ~1.292 WSOL-per-jitoSOL — a ~19.6x gap, conclusively ruling out a
 * constant-product read of the vaults (the SAME conclusion Scorch's own
 * file reached, there by a much smaller ~20% gap). The measured rate was
 * also near-FLAT across a 40x size range (1.29214 @ 0.05 SOL down to
 * 1.29208 @ 2 SOL, jitoSOL->WSOL) — the live per-mint oracle field is the
 * ~ONLY driver of price; the vault balance's real role is purely a hard
 * CAPACITY ceiling (a 50 SOL probe against the same pool — whose WSOL vault
 * held only ~3 WSOL — reverted `Custom(7)` rather than partially filling,
 * exactly the "vault balance as the cap" shape this integration's brief
 * named up front).
 *
 * ── ACCOUNT LAYOUT ──
 * PAIR (724 bytes, owned by this program): mintA @41 (32B), mintB @73 (32B),
 * a per-asset "role-B" record's OWN address @106 (32B, right after mintB —
 * ground-truthed: this is EXACTLY `accounts[4]` of every real swap CPI on
 * that pair, for 4 different pools/mint-pairs). mintA's OWN per-asset
 * records (`accounts[3]`/`accounts[5]`/`accounts[15]` of the real CPI — a
 * 128-byte "AssetConfig", a variable-length ~3.9-11.6KB "growing" history
 * account, and a 998-byte "meta" account) are NOT embedded anywhere in the
 * PAIR bytes (an exhaustive substring search over the full 724 bytes found
 * none of the three) and are not derivable via any PDA seed scheme this
 * pass could recover (~40 seed-literal x order x tag-byte combinations
 * tried against `getProgramDerivedAddress`, all misses) — they are vendored
 * per known mintA below (`HADRON_ASSET_REGISTRY`), the same "vendor what
 * can't be derived" shape as Scorch's `SCORCH_ASSET_CONFIGS`. mintB's own
 * per-asset "role-B" 56-byte record, in contrast, IS embedded in the PAIR
 * account (@106) and needs no vendoring.
 *
 * The 686-byte "global" account is NOT a single protocol-wide singleton — 3
 * of our 4 real pools shared one global address but the 4th (ORCA/USDC)
 * used a DIFFERENT one — so it is vendored per-mintA alongside the rest of
 * the registry, not hardcoded as a constant.
 *
 * vaultA/vaultB are the pool PDA's OWN standard Associated Token Accounts
 * (verified: `findAssociatedTokenPda({owner: pool, mint})` reproduces the
 * real vault address exactly for 2 different pools/4 different mints) — no
 * vendoring needed. The fee-destination account is likewise a standard ATA
 * of a single, fixed, venue-wide fee-treasury wallet
 * (`HADRON_FEE_AUTHORITY`) for whichever mint is the trade's INPUT —
 * verified exact against 3 different mints' real fee-destination addresses
 * from real landed transactions.
 *
 * SCOPE: this adapter only serves the SPECIFIC (mintA, mintB) pairing each
 * registry entry validates the price field against (see
 * `HADRON_ASSET_REGISTRY`) — real gPA census shows WSOL alone appears as
 * mintA in 30 of the 129 real PAIR accounts, spread across dozens of
 * distinct mintB partners we have NOT validated the field's units for; a
 * pool whose mintB does not match the registered quote self-drops with a
 * named error rather than risk a wrong-denominated rate (the "one bad
 * candidate never kills discovery" convention). The 4 registered pairs
 * (jitoSOL/WSOL, USDC/USDT, WSOL/USDC, ORCA/USDC) are exactly the ones this
 * pass could ground-truth.
 *
 * See ladder.ts for the swap instruction / account list, the quote model +
 * its evidence, and the measured CU.
