/**
 * Mercurial Finance Stable Swap (`stable-swap-n-pool`) — the pre-Meteora
 * multi-token stableswap, program `MERLuDFBMmsHnsBPZw2sDQZHvXFMwp8EdjudcU2HKky`
 * (same address on mainnet-beta and devnet; Saber's own `stable-swap`
 * program is a documented fork of this exact codebase, which is why the
 * Newton math below matches saber-stableswap's `ann = amp*2` convention
 * bit-for-bit rather than the generalized Curve `ann = amp*n^n`).
 *
 * Layout source: `mercurial-finance/stable-swap-n-pool-instructions`
 * (`src/state.rs`'s `SwapV2`, `src/instruction.rs`'s `SwapInstruction`) and
 * `mercurial-finance/stable-swap-n-pool-js` (`src/index.ts`'s
 * `FEE_DENOMINATOR = 1e10`, the client account ordering for `Exchange`).
 * `SwapV2` is a Vec-backed struct but every array is declared at its
 * compile-time MAX (`PoolParameter::MAX_N_COINS = 4`), so every pool account
 * is a FIXED 265 bytes (1 version tag + `SwapV2::LEN` 264) regardless of how
 * many of the 4 coin slots are actually in use — `getProgramAccounts`
 * filtered on `dataSize: 265` finds every pool with no memcmp needed (the
 * -32010 the brief warns about is a Helius secondary-index limit on an
 * UNFILTERED gPA call; a plain `dataSize` filter is a primary index and
 * works directly, confirmed live: 24 pools returned in one call).
 *
 * THIS ADAPTER IS 2-COIN ONLY (a deliberate, checked scope limit, not a
 * layout gap): `stableComputeD`/`stableComputeYWarm` (shared with
 * saber-stableswap and meteora-damm-v1-stable) implement the CLASSIC 2-asset
 * invariant (`ann = amp*2`); a genuinely N>2 Mercurial pool (real examples
 * exist on-chain, e.g. 3- and 4-coin USD baskets) needs the generalized
 * N-coin Newton iteration (`ann = amp*n^n`, D/Y summed over every balance),
 * which is different math this repo does not implement. `fetchPoolConfig`
 * throws (self-drops the pool, never emits wrong-math bytecode) whenever
 * `tokens_len !== 2`.
 *
 * PRECISION MULTIPLIERS — the wrinkle Saber's 2-token-only design never
 * needed: each coin slot carries a live `precision_multipliers[i]` (u64,
 * `SetPrecisionMultipliers`-admin-settable) that both aligns decimals AND
 * bakes in a fixed exchange-rate snapshot for yield-bearing pairs (measured
 * live 2026-07-31: the mSOL/SOL pool `MAR1zHjHaQcniE2gXsDptkyKUnNfMEsLBVcfP7vLyv7`
 * carries `[1000, 1128]` — 1.128 being that pool's mSOL/SOL rate at whatever
 * point an admin last called `SetPrecisionMultipliers`, NOT live-updating
 * per-trade). The invariant math runs on VIRTUAL balances
 * `raw_reserve_i * precision_multipliers[i]` — homogeneous-degree-1 in the
 * multiplier choice, so D/Y math is exact for ANY shared scale, and only the
 * de-normalization (`virtual / precision_multipliers[dst]`) and the FEE
 * matter for byte-exactness. VALIDATED against the REAL deployed program
 * (see below) that the fee itself must be taken IN VIRTUAL SPACE before
 * de-normalizing — `dyRaw = floor((dyVirtual - floor(dyVirtual*fn/1e10)) / dstMult)`,
 * NOT `floor(dyVirtual/dstMult) - floor(floor(dyVirtual/dstMult)*fn/1e10)` —
 * the latter is off by up to a few raw units on any pool with a non-unit
 * multiplier (measured +1 raw-unit residual at 2 of 3 tested sizes on the
 * mSOL/SOL pool before the fix; 0 residual after, at all tested sizes on all
 * three real pools below).
 *
 * NO AMP RAMP: unlike Saber (and unlike Curve's usual `start/target/ramp_ts`
 * quad), Mercurial's `SwapV2.amplification_coefficient` is a single live u64
 * that `AdminSetting::SetAmplificationCoefficient` overwrites INSTANTLY —
 * there is no time-interpolated ramp field in the account at all (confirmed
 * from `state.rs`: the struct has no `initial_amp`/`target_amp`/ramp
 * timestamps, only the one field). The fragment therefore just reads amp
 * live, no branch.
 *
 * `admin_fee_numerator` is a stored-but-UNUSED field (`state.rs`'s own doc
 * comment: "Admin fee numerator, not implemented") — every sampled live pool
 * (24, all admin_fee_numerator = 0) confirms it; this adapter never reads it.
 * `FEE_DENOMINATOR` is a fixed protocol constant (`1e10`, from the JS SDK),
 * NOT a per-pool stored field, so it is baked as a compile-time literal.
 *
 * BIDIRECTIONAL: unlike Saber (asymmetric admin-fee-destination account,
 * A->B only in this codebase) and meteora-damm-v1-stable, Mercurial's
 * `Exchange` instruction accounts are fully symmetric — both vaults ride the
 * account list in STORED order regardless of which mint is source/dest, and
 * there is no direction-specific admin-fee account at all. So this adapter
 * serves BOTH `aToB` and `bToA`, doubling real coverage over the Saber
 * precedent for no extra on-chain cost.
 *
 * VALIDATED against the REAL deployed program on REAL mainnet state (LiteSVM
 * `simulateTransaction`, `sigVerify:false` impersonating a real token holder
 * as `userTransferAuthority` — never a funds-moving tx) at 3+ sizes on THREE
 * independent real pools, RE-CONFIRMED at fixture-capture time (2026-07-31;
 * these pools trade continuously — a pool's live reserves are a MOVING
 * TARGET, so `test/svm/venues/mercurial.test.ts`'s pinned numbers are a
 * regression pin against its OWN checked-in fixture snapshot, not a
 * permanent real-time truth — re-derive if the fixtures are ever recaptured):
 *  - `SoLw5ovBPNfodtAbxqEKHLGppyrdB4aZthdGwpfpQgi` (mult=[1,1], SOL vs an
 *    unlabeled SPL mint): 1/10/50 tokens, bit-exact at all three.
 *  - `MAR1zHjHaQcniE2gXsDptkyKUnNfMEsLBVcfP7vLyv7` (SOL/mSOL, mult=[1000,1128]):
 *    1/5/20 mSOL, bit-exact at all three (post-fix; see the fee-rounding note
 *    above for the pre-fix residual).
 *  - `LiDoU8ymvYptqxenJ4YpcURBchn4ef63tcbdznBCKJh` (stSOL/SOL, mult=[1122,1000]):
 *    1/10/30 stSOL, bit-exact at all three.
 * See `test/svm/venues/mercurial.test.ts` for the pinned worked examples.
 *
 * NO `the consuming app realcpi e2e test` CELL (unlike every other SAUCE_VENUE_PROGRAMS-gated
 * venue): driving the real dumped `mercurial.so` through a raw single Exchange
 * CPI in LiteSVM (same pool/accounts/encoding the real-network probe above
 * validates) reproducibly fails a RUNTIME-LEVEL "sum of account balances
 * before and after instruction do not match" check — AFTER the program's own
 * logic (GetFeeAmount, GetDyUnderlying, both inner SPL transfers) already
 * completes correctly and reproduces the exact real-network quote. This is
 * independent of pool / precision-multiplier / lamport magnitude / SPL
 * `is_native` flagging / LiteSVM feature set (all varied individually, zero
 * change in outcome or CU) and is read as a LiteSVM-specific compatibility
 * gap with this one 2021-era non-Anchor binary — `simulateTransaction`
 * against REAL mainnet-beta runs the SAME Agave runtime code path as full
 * execution (unlike LiteSVM's independent reimplementation) and succeeds
 * cleanly, which is why the real-network probe above is trusted as the
 * fund-safety proof. budget.ts's `mercurial` CU_FAMILIES entry documents the
 * real CPI's OWN measured compute cost (61_473 CU, captured before that
 * runtime check fires) and folds it into the pin with a safety margin.
 *
 * Gates: 265-byte account size, version byte == 2 (SwapV2), initialized,
 * exactly 2 coin slots, both vault accounts classic-SPL (165 bytes) and
 * owned by the derived authority. `swap_enabled` is a live-reversible admin
 * toggle (same class as Saber's `is_paused`) — NOT a fetch-time gate; the
 * fragment re-checks it live every trade (a disabled pool quotes 0 and never
 * pays its CPI, the same self-drop-by-zero-quote convention Saber uses).
