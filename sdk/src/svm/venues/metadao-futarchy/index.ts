/**
 * MetaDAO Futarchy AMM — spot leg (SvmRoute ladder fragment).
 *
 * MetaDAO's `futarchy` program (fully open source,
 * github.com/metaDAOproject/programs, `programs/futarchy/src/`) embeds a
 * `FutarchyAmm` directly on each `Dao` account: `amm.state` is a `PoolState`
 * enum, `Spot { spot: Pool }` (no proposal in flight — a plain two-reserve
 * constant-product AMM) or `Futarchy { spot, pass, fail }` (an active
 * proposal — three linked pools). This module wires ONLY the `Spot` variant
 * (per the integration plan): a `spotSwap` against a `Futarchy`-state dao
 * ALSO runs `arbitrage_after_spot_swap` — a 100-step off-chain-style search
 * that rebalances spot against the conditional pass/fail markets
 * (`programs/programs/futarchy/src/state/futarchy_amm.rs:60-83` at the
 * `2d4ceb`-adjacent tree fetched 2026-07-31) — which this recipe does not
 * model. Conditional (pass/fail) markets stay OUT of the universe until that
 * leg lands; `fetchPoolConfig` below gates any `Futarchy`-state dao with a
 * named error (self-drop, same shape as every other prepare-time gate in
 * this recipe) rather than emitting a wrong quote for it.
 *
 * SAFE ON A LATE STATE FLIP (prepare fetched Spot, the dao transitions to
 * Futarchy before the cook lands): `arbitrage_after_spot_swap`'s search only
 * ever ACCEPTS a candidate that raises `best_profit` above 0
 * (`state/futarchy_amm.rs:671-677`), so the real output is always
 * `spot_output + arbitrage_result.spot_profit` with `spot_profit >= 0` — the
 * plain two-reserve quote below is a FLOOR on the real fill, never an
 * over-promise. `minOut` (the recipe's sole atomic bound) stays safe either
 * way; no on-chain state-tag re-check is worth the extra codegen.
 *
 * QUOTE MATH (`Pool::swap`, `state/futarchy_amm.rs:495-546`): a protocol fee
 * is taken off the input, then the REMAINDER runs a plain Uniswap-v1-style
 * constant-product swap (LP_TAKER_FEE_BPS is 0 today, so the "LP fee" leg is
 * an identity multiply that cancels exactly — see the derivation below):
 *
 *   netIn  = floor(x * (MAX_BPS - PROTOCOL_TAKER_FEE_BPS) / MAX_BPS)   [protocol fee]
 *   out    = floor(netIn * reserveOut / (reserveIn + netIn))
 *
 * Full derivation of the collapse (`programs/futarchy/src/lib.rs:42-50` pins
 * MAX_BPS=10_000, PROTOCOL_TAKER_FEE_BPS=50, LP_TAKER_FEE_BPS=0 — program-wide
 * constants, not stored per-pool on chain, so this adapter bakes them at
 * compile time like any other closed-source-equivalent constant; re-verify
 * against the cited lines if MetaDAO ever redeploys with different fees):
 * `input_amount_after_lp_fee = netIn * (MAX_BPS - LP_TAKER_FEE_BPS) = netIn *
 * MAX_BPS` (exact, no floor, since the multiplier is a whole `MAX_BPS`);
 * `numerator = input_amount_after_lp_fee * reserveOut = netIn * MAX_BPS *
 * reserveOut`; `denominator = reserveIn * MAX_BPS + input_amount_after_lp_fee
 * = MAX_BPS * (reserveIn + netIn)`. `MAX_BPS` divides numerator and
 * denominator exactly, so `floor(numerator / denominator) === floor(netIn *
 * reserveOut / (reserveIn + netIn))` bit-for-bit — the two-step Rust
 * computation and the one-step form above always agree. Monotone
 * non-decreasing and concave in `x` (a haircut constant-product is still a
 * constant-product), so it cannot trigger the "coarse ladder gets allocated
 * ZERO" failure mode.
 *
 * ACCOUNTS: `spotSwap`'s 9-account order (dao, userBaseAccount,
 * userQuoteAccount, ammBaseVault, ammQuoteVault, user, tokenProgram,
 * eventAuthority, program — `programs/futarchy/src/instructions/spot_swap.rs`)
 * was cross-checked against two real mainnet transactions on two different
 * Spot-state daos (signatures `3rJxfuQ...` and `4MtVuNv...`/`2NPHutC...`,
 * fetched via a keyless `getTransaction`) — both matched this order exactly,
 * INCLUDING `eventAuthority` (Anchor's `#[event_cpi]` self-log PDA,
 * `["__event_authority"]` off the program id — computed once, pinned below,
 * and matched byte-for-byte against both transactions' account lists).
 *
 * CPI CU: measured directly off those two real mainnet transactions' logs
 * ("Program FUTARELB...consumed 40708 of..." on the flagship META/USDC dao,
 * "...consumed 39309 of..." on the SoLo/USDC dao — both PoolState::Spot,
 * both already including the nested `emit_cpi` self-log's own ~3634 CU) —
 * see `the consuming app SVM CU-budget module`'s `CU_FAMILIES.metadao-futarchy` for how that
 * folds into the pin.
