/**
 * Solayer EndoAVS delegation venue adapter — program
 * `endoLNCKTqDn8gSVnN2hDdpgACUPWHZTwoYnnMybpAT` (Jupiter's own
 * `program-id-to-label` capture, `benchmark/adapters/fixtures/
 * jupiter-program-id-to-label.json`, calls this program "Solayer").
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY IS (there is no public on-chain IDL for it —
 * everything below is reverse-engineered from live mainnet state plus one
 * corroborating source, see "GROUND TRUTH" below): it is NOT the sSOL
 * mint/redeem stake pool itself (that is a *different* program,
 * `sSo1iU21jBrU9VaJ8PJib1MtorefUV4fzC9GURa2KNn`, wrapping the SPL stake
 * pool at `po1osKDWYF9oiVEGmzKA4eTs8eMveFRMox3bUKazGN2` — see
 * `solayer-labs/solayer-cli`'s `restaking/` folder — which needs a
 * withdraw-stake + deactivate QUEUE to redeem, exactly the queued path this
 * family avoids). `endoLNCK...` is Solayer's **EndoAVS delegation**
 * program: it lets an sSOL holder "delegate" sSOL 1:1 into a per-AVS
 * "delegated" receipt token (e.g. `sonickAJFi...` for the "Sonic" AVS,
 * `hash4eTHs...` for "Hashkey Cloud AVS", 20 such AVS pools live at
 * integration time — `getProgramAccounts` on this program id returns
 * EXACTLY 20 accounts, all 443 bytes, no other account type exists under
 * this program) and "undelegate" back. Both directions are FULLY ATOMIC —
 * no queue, no cooldown, no separate ticket account (verified against 3
 * real mainnet transactions at 3 different sizes/pools/directions, see
 * "VALIDATION" below) — so unlike the plan's default caution ("wire the
 * atomic direction first"), there is no non-atomic direction to drop here;
 * this family wires BOTH.
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH: `solayer-labs/solayer-cli`'s `endoavs/utils/constants.ts`
 * (`PROGRAM_ID = endoLNCKTqDn8gSVnN2hDdpgACUPWHZTwoYnnMybpAT`,
 * `DELEGATED_TOKEN_MINT_ID = sSo14endRuUbvQaJS3dq36Q829a3A6BEfoeeRGJywEh`)
 * and `endoavs/utils/type.ts`'s hand-written `EndoAvs` TS type
 * (`{ bump, authority, avsTokenMint, delegatedTokenMint,
 * delegatedTokenVault, name, url }`) — this is a CLI author's own partial
 * reconstruction, not a published Anchor IDL (its `instructions` list is
 * missing the `_no_init` variants this adapter actually uses), but its
 * field ORDER matches this adapter's independently-decoded byte layout
 * exactly, and the account discriminator computed from its type name
 * (`sha256("account:EndoAVS")[0..8]` = `42a829b1bb0bad7b`) is
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL to all 20 real pool accounts' leading 8 bytes — strong
 * independent corroboration that this is genuinely the account's Anchor
 * name, not a coincidence.
 *
 * ACCOUNT LAYOUT (`EndoAVS`, 443 bytes, Anchor-standard 8-byte
 * discriminator then declared-field order, Borsh-packed) — decoded from
 * all 20 live pool accounts, cross-checked against real instruction
 * account lists (below):
 *   [0..8)    discriminator = sha256("account:EndoAVS")[0..8]
 *   [8..40)   authority     Pubkey (the AVS's admin; several pools share one)
 *   [40..41)  bump          u8
 *   [41..73)  avsTokenMint  Pubkey — THIS adapter's `receiptMint` (per-pool, varies)
 *   [73..105) lstMint       Pubkey — always `sSo14endRuUbvQaJS3dq36Q829a3A6BEfoeeRGJywEh` (sSOL) on all 20 live pools
 *   [105..137) vault        Pubkey — the SPL token account (owned by this program's PDA) holding delegated sSOL
 *   [137..)   name          Borsh String (u32 LE length + UTF-8 bytes)
 *   [..)      url           Borsh String (u32 LE length + UTF-8 bytes) — often unset (zero length)
 *   [..443)   reserved padding (observed all-zero on every live pool; may carry
 *             future fields the CLI's partial IDL does not yet name — never read here)
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS — two ANCHOR-standard discriminators
 * (`sha256("global:<snake_case name>")[0..8]`), recovered from real
 * transaction `Program log: Instruction: <Name>` lines and independently
 * confirmed by recomputing the sha256 of the candidate snake_case name and
 * matching it byte-for-byte against the real instruction data's leading 8
 * bytes (both matched exactly — see VALIDATION):
 *   delegate_no_init   fe 00 de 28 91 76 6e 14   (mints receiptMint 1:1 for sSOL)
 *   undelegate_no_init d5 11 d7 51 05 72 7c 4e   (burns receiptMint 1:1 for sSOL)
 * Both take a SINGLE u64 LE amount argument immediately after the
 * discriminator (no trailing min-out/slippage word — this program has no
 * partial-fill or slippage concept of its own; the recipe's own terminal
 * outAta-delta check is what enforces `minOut`, exactly like every other
 * venue here). The `_no_init` suffix (vs. the base `delegate`/`undelegate`
 * the CLI's stale partial IDL names) means neither instruction creates the
 * destination ATA — this recipe's ATAs are always pre-resolved, so `_no_init`
 * is the correct (cheaper) variant, same reasoning as every other venue's
 * ATA handling in this recipe.
 *
 * Both instructions share ONE account order for BOTH directions (only
 * which physical account plays "in" vs "out" changes; the ORDER doesn't):
 *   0 user            signer
 *   1 pool (EndoAVS)   PDA, read-only (its bump/authority fields sign
 *                      internally via invoke_signed; the caller never signs for it)
 *   2 receiptMint      writable (its supply changes: minted on delegate, burned on undelegate)
 *   3 vault            writable (its sSOL balance changes)
 *   4 lstMint          read-only (sSOL mint, mint-checked by `transfer_checked`)
 *   5 user's sSOL ATA      writable (source on delegate, destination on undelegate)
 *   6 user's receiptMint ATA writable (destination on delegate, source on undelegate)
 *   7 token program
 * (delegate: burn/transfer inner ixs observed as `transfer_checked(sSOL: user->vault)` then
 * `mint_to(receiptMint: ->user)`, both for the SAME amount; undelegate: `burn(receiptMint: user)`
 * then `transfer_checked(sSOL: vault->user)`, again the SAME amount both sides.)
 *
 * QUOTE MATH: EXACT 1:1, NO FEE. There is no fee/exchange-rate field
 * anywhere in the 443-byte account (every byte past `url` is zero on
 * every one of the 20 live pools), and all 3 real transactions below
 * transferred/minted/burned the IDENTICAL raw amount on both legs. The
 * only real constraint is CAPACITY, and it is DIRECTIONAL and HARD (a
 * step function, not a diminishing curve):
 *   - delegate (sSOL -> receiptMint): bounded only by the receiptMint's
 *     remaining u64 mint headroom (`2^64-1 - supply`) — astronomically
 *     large in practice (observed live supplies are ~10^12-10^13 raw,
 *     ~13 orders of magnitude under the u64 ceiling) but modeled exactly
 *     rather than assumed infinite, so a pathological near-max-supply pool
 *     is still never over-quoted.
 *   - undelegate (receiptMint -> sSOL): bounded by the vault's LIVE sSOL
 *     balance (an `accountUint` read at execution time) — the real,
 *     binding constraint (a live-observed pool has vault balance *above*
 *     its receipt supply by a materially nonzero amount — some
 *     out-of-band sSOL entered the vault outside delegate/undelegate,
 *     e.g. reward accrual or a direct top-up; capacity is read from the
 *     vault directly, never assumed equal to supply, so this is harmless).
 * Both are exactly `min(x, cap)` — monotone non-decreasing and concave
 * (the min of an affine function and a constant), satisfying the merge's
 * ladder-curve requirement with no curvature to model at all.
 *
 * VALIDATION (three real mainnet transactions, three sizes, both
 * directions, two different AVS pools — decoded via `getTransaction`
 * `jsonParsed` + inner-instruction `parsed.info`, not guessed):
 *   delegate,   Sonic pool    (via a Jupiter RouteV2 leg): 208_072_380 sSOL in
 *               -> 208_072_380 sonicK minted.  tx H7JUL9QEcrnnsSXDGzW2mYap1t4n9jAmk9xvmtwNmP5m8Jn4sED8h582Tph96epsz7yoAW2LY1yBqHQtZxyHHby
 *   undelegate, Sonic pool    (direct top-level call):     3_010_000_000 sonicK burned
 *               -> 3_010_000_000 sSOL out. tx 5jRGKMb7simyMyYp3bbviMhc1pndgGEnSv2oRWsQd6fjkEEH1rM8g64fAcUoGmHf25WXLYQuSQv7FnxAjh9yMfcX
 *   undelegate, Hashkey Cloud AVS pool (via a Jupiter SharedAccountsRouteV2 leg): 12_450_000 hash4eT burned
 *               -> 12_450_000 sSOL out. tx 4bnVs3683krULUFbQc6sC7Yx5pJNaDbnxBu12uW2ikMrZq3qgSX3ZLgcPdRwsNr4KuwffwnbMNAqyZCKjXjGGNzf
 * `the consuming app solayer e2e test` replays real fixture dumps of
 * the Sonic and Hashkey Cloud AVS pools (`test/svm/fixtures/solayer{,-dir1}`,
 * captured at integration time) through `referenceQuote` AND through the
 * real committed engine, and separately drives the REAL dumped
 * `solayer.so` program binary (SAUCE_VENUE_PROGRAMS-gated real-CPI cell)
 * to prove this adapter's exact instruction/account encoding is accepted
 * by the live program, not merely self-consistent.
 *
 * Both mints are classic Tokenkeg (82-byte SPL mint accounts) on every one
 * of the 20 live pools plus the shared sSOL mint — confirmed via
 * `getMultipleAccounts`, no Token-2022 extension mint observed anywhere in
 * this family, so this adapter gates on that (Tokenkeg-only, like most of
 * this recipe's other venues) rather than modeling transfer-fee extensions.
