/**
 * spl-token-swap FORKS — six independently-deployed programs that all run the
 * SAME open-source `solana-labs/solana-program-library` `token-swap` codebase
 * (Token Swap itself, DexLab, Saros, Orca's ORIGINAL v1 fork, Penguin, StepN's
 * Dooar): the identical 324-byte `SwapVersion::SwapV1` account layout (no
 * discriminator, manual `Pack`), the identical `Swap` instruction (tag 1,
 * `[amount_in u64 LE][minimum_amount_out u64 LE]`, the same 10-account order),
 * and the identical constant-product-with-fees math the sibling
 * `orca-legacy-token-swap` adapter (itself a
 * SEPARATE spl-token-swap fork at program `9W959DqEETiGZocYWCQPaJ6sBmUzgfxXfqGeTEdp3aQP`)
 * already decodes and quotes — see that adapter's header for the shared
 * derivation. The only thing that differs PER FORK is the deployed program id
 * (which changes both the `create_program_address` swap-authority PDA domain
 * and the CPI target), so this module is a single parameterized factory
 * instantiated once per program id below, not six copies of the math.
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH for the six program ids: Jupiter's own `program-id-to-label`
 * capture (`benchmark/adapters/fixtures/jupiter-program-id-to-label.json`) —
 * `SwaPpA9LAaLfeLi3a68M4DjnLqgtticKg6CnyNwgAC8` "Token Swap",
 * `DSwpgjMvXhtGn6BsbqmacdBZyfLj6jSWf3HJpdJtmg6N` "DexLab",
 * `SSwapUtytfBdBn1b9NUGG6foMVPtcWgpRU32HToDUZr` "Saros",
 * `DjVE6JNiYqPL2QXyCUUh8rNjHrbz9hXHNYt99MQ59qw1` "Orca V1" (a GENUINELY
 * DIFFERENT program from "Orca V2"'s `9W959D...` — confirmed live, see
 * `benchmark/adapters/_svm-venues.ts`'s prior no-analogue note, now
 * superseded by this wiring),
 * `PSwapMdSai8tjrEXcxFeQth87xC4rRsa4VA5mhGhXkP` "Penguin",
 * `Dooar9JkhdZ7J3LHN3A7YCuoGRUggXhQaG4kijfLGU2j` "StepN". Live pool counts at
 * this 324-byte layout (measured 2026-07-31 via a keyless `getProgramAccounts`
 * memcmp sweep, `curve_type` (offset 291) filtered to 0 = constant product):
 * DexLab 2,097 / Saros 554 / Token Swap 339 / Orca V1 31 / Penguin 29 /
 * StepN 6 pools.
 *
 * FIVE of the six are FULLY WIRED and real-CPI proven at 3+ sizes each
 * against their own real mainnet fixture pool and their own real dumped
 * binary (see the consuming app realcpi e2e test): token-swap-v1,
 * orca-v1, penguin, stepn, and (2026-08-03, see `saros`'s own doc comment
 * below for the conservative-margin resolution) saros. The remaining ONE —
 * dexlab — is WIRED (program id, discovery filter, CU entry, all exercised
 * the same as the other five) but GATED: `fetchPoolConfig` throws
 * unconditionally for every pool of that family (see
 * `makeSplTokenSwapForkAdapter`'s `unresolvedGate` parameter, and its own
 * doc comment below for exactly what
 * real-CPI testing found and why it isn't safe to guess at). A gated family
 * can never enter the electable universe (`resolveSvmPoolSpec` drops any
 * `fetchPoolConfig` throw) — so this is a zero-risk placeholder for a
 * follow-up, not a shipped-but-wrong integration.
 *
 * The spl-token-swap STABLE curve (`curve_type` nonzero, an amplification
 * coefficient in the calculator blob) is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE here, same
 * as `orca-legacy-token-swap` — `fetchPoolConfig` throws on any nonzero
 * `curve_type` rather than silently mis-pricing a stable pool with CP math.

 * `Djxfn7zWFxFqYgwesXfq8BeAirfXwfhQmNcCousXh7G7`, dumped 2026-07-31) found
 * the same fee-MODEL divergence this comment used to describe: REALIZED
 * output across 14 independently-sampled real trades (27,995 to 6,089,579
 * raw units) implies an effective swap fee of a clean, reproducible ~4 bps —
 * NOT the 30 bps the pool's own on-chain `owner_trade_fee` field states
 * (`trade_fee` reads 0 bps). The account layout is confirmed correct up
 * through `pool_fee_account` (the swap only succeeds because that key check
 * passes) — this is a genuine fee-MODEL divergence, not a decode bug: Saros's
 * deployed program evidently does not compute the swap fee the vanilla
 * spl-token-swap way from the fields at these offsets, and no public source
 * was available to determine the real rule (the likely explanation, not
 * confirmed: the stored `owner_trade_fee` sizes how many LP tokens this fork
 * mints to `pool_fee_account` — confirmed growing consistent with invariant
 * growth on every sampled trade — while the amount actually deducted from
 * the trader's output is governed by a separate, unrecovered constant).
 *
 * Rather than continue gating on an unresolved exact rule, this adapter
 * deliberately keeps the generic `makeSplTokenSwapForkAdapter` formula
 * (the STORED, higher trade+owner fee rates as the netIn deduction) as a
 * MEASURED, DELIBERATE safety margin: across all 14 sampled trades this
 * model's predicted output was strictly <= the real realized output every
 * time (margins of ~0.05%-0.26% of the trade) — never an over-promise, so
 * quoting it is safe for election (a worse model never wins a share it
 * doesn't deserve), the same closed-source-fork trade-off `gamma`'s
 * dynamic-fee ceiling already makes. Proven end-to-end against the real
 * deployed binary in LiteSVM at 2 and 4 rungs plus three additional sizes
 * (`predicted <= realized` at every sampled size, never `===`, unlike the
