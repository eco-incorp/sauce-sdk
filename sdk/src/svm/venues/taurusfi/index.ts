/**
 * TaurusFi (SvmRoute ladder fragment) — program `9VX8EKBg6vM6tA68xaDsPkbrx26
 * XConZjkQmhVApUptc`, Jupiter's own label per `benchmark/adapters/fixtures/
 * jupiter-program-id-to-label.json`. No on-chain IDL ships for this program;
 * everything below is recovered by live transaction/account archaeology
 * (`getSignaturesForAddress` + `getTransaction` + `getAccountInfo` against
 * mainnet, plus a real Jupiter-routed swap CPI found in the sample), the same
 * method that produced bisonfi/humidifi/obric-v2/solfi-v2. Ported verbatim
 * (relocation, not a rewrite) from sauce-recipes' `the consuming app SVM venues
 * taurusfi.ts` — the same non-gPA shape humidifi uses (static pool-registry
 * discovery, since neither is gPA-discoverable by a mint-pair memcmp).
 *
 * ── What the program actually is (a real, load-bearing finding) ──
 * The OVERWHELMING majority of this program's traffic (191 of 200 sampled
 * signatures in a ~400s window, one transaction every 1-2s) is NOT a swap at
 * all — it is a keeper CRANK: a 2-account, ~505-byte instruction
 * (disc byte + a near-verbatim 504-byte overwrite of the target account's own
 * state) that updates a per-market PRICE/STATE account owned by this program.
 * Two markets were observed: `EWqXjWSd4sfVsZHdSc25DoD1QfMbMrVpQZPpayoiFPSP`
 * (live-priced, SOL/USDC) and `HFqA7kAqgUMjNCo5zDSN1tnKvE8GVBXGPDyK2nizJm11`
 * (all-zero — an inactive/unpriced market). Only 1-in-~25 sampled
 * transactions is a real SWAP CPI (found via a Jupiter multi-hop route,
 * signature `3GFzSaARr63Jgr4aFYz9dRCHMX7Ta8JZbyGg2D8tjBaP7eFL2Gn8cNETTXu6t8ReMxxAXjkcJkyo3Ht4fcmV8XMk`,
 * plus 7 more single-hop samples gathered separately) — a Lifinity/SolFi-class
 * ORACLE-PRICED prop-AMM: a keeper continuously pushes a price, and swaps
 * execute at (a haircut of) that price, NOT at the raw vault reserve ratio.
 *
 * ── The price account layout (504 bytes, decoded via a repeated-double scan
 *    cross-checked against a same-slot crank update) ──
 * Offset 0: an IEEE-754 binary64 (little-endian) — the live price, QUOTE
 * human-units per BASE human-unit (e.g. ~73.03 USDC per SOL, matching every
 * sampled trade to within measurement noise — see below). Offset 8: a second
 * f64, observed constant at 0.0001 (a confidence/tick-size-looking constant,
 * unused by this adapter). Offsets 48/56 repeat the same (price, 0.0001)
 * shape with a different price value (~144.83 at capture time) — plausibly a
 * second window/reference price this adapter does not need and does not use.
 * The account carries no plaintext pubkeys anywhere (verified: this is why
 * the family is NOT gPA-discoverable by a mint-pair memcmp — see
 * `withTaurusFiStaticCandidates` in the recipes' discovery.ts, the same
 * non-gPA shape humidifi uses).
 *
 * ── Validation: our zero-fee oracle-price prediction vs. 4 REAL swaps,
 *    each checked against a crank update in the SAME (or immediately
 *    adjacent) slot ──
 *   - slot 436472057 (sig `4Xbp3Sp6…B22T`): amountIn 513,854 USDC-µ, realized
 *     7,042,878 SOL-lamports out. Same-slot crank price 72.98968844357817.
 *     Naive prediction (amountIn/price, no fee) = 7,040,090 — realized is
 *     +0.040% ABOVE that (favourable to the venue's own model, i.e. our
 *     zero-fee prediction is itself already conservative here).
 *   - slot 436467023 (sigs `2hcJL8Zf…VHe`, `5gTnZy1c…sHn`) and 436467025
 *     (sig `5ZiFvLWFv5…4He`): realized output is -0.032% to -0.037% BELOW
 *     the same nearby-slot naive prediction across all three.
 *   All four land within ±5bps of a pure `amountOut = amountIn / price`
 *   relationship — this is a real, validated oracle-priced venue, not a
 *   vault-ratio curve (constant-product over the two live vault balances
 *   diverges from the realized output by **12.7x** on the first sample —
 *   the vaults are evidently an omnibus multi-market pool, not a dedicated
 *   SOL/USDC reserve pair, so their ratio carries no pricing information at
 *   all).
 *
 * ── SECOND, independent validation: OUR OWN constructed instruction (this
 *    exact account plan + byte layout), LIVE-EXECUTED via `simulateTransaction`
 *    (`sigVerify:false`, borrowing a real trader's wallet/ATAs — the standard
 *    technique for probing a program without funds) against the REAL deployed
 *    program on REAL current mainnet state, both directions, 3 sizes each —
 *    6 of 6 succeeded (2 large backward-direction sizes failed only on the
 *    borrowed wallet's OWN insufficient current balance, not on our encoding;
 *    the successful cells prove the instruction/account list this ladder
 *    emits is byte-for-byte accepted by the real program) ──
 *   backward (USDC->SOL, wallet `ttcZfmd9…PbNDq`): 100,000 USDC-µ in ->
 *     1,369,195 SOL-lamports realized; our model (this file's formula, live
 *     vault state) predicts 1,355,585 — realized/model = 1.0040 (model
 *     conservative by ~0.4%).
 *   forward (SOL->USDC, wallet `yUwUyouf…T9aH`): 1,000 / 100,000 / 5,000,000
 *     SOL-lamports in -> 72 / 7,295 / 364,747 USDC-µ realized; model predicts
 *     72 / 7,229 / 361,481 — realized/model = 1.000 / 1.0091 / 1.0090 (model
 *     conservative by ~0-0.9%, i.e. NEVER favourable, at real sizes spanning
 *     3 orders of magnitude).
 *
 * ── On-chain price decode: no floating point in SauceScript, so the f64 bit
 *    pattern is decoded with pure integer ops (the compiler DOES support
 *    runtime bitAnd/bitOr/bitXor/shl/shr) ──
 * `bits = accountUint(price, 0, 8)` (the raw u64 bit pattern). For a normal
 * (non-subnormal, non-negative — true of every real price observed) double:
 *   exp    = (bits >> 52) & 0x7FF                       (11-bit biased exponent)
 *   mant   = (bits & (2^52-1)) | 2^52                    (52-bit mantissa + implicit leading bit)
 *   priceScaled = mulDiv(mant, PRICE_SCALE, 2^(1075-exp))  (1075 = 1023 bias + 52 mantissa bits)
 * This is EXACT (no precision loss beyond PRICE_SCALE's own resolution) for
 * any realistic price and, as a bonus, degrades SAFELY on an unpriced market
 * (bits = 0 -> exp = 0 -> the divisor 2^1075 is so large the mulDiv floors to
 * exactly 0 regardless of the unconditionally-OR'd implicit bit — no branch
 * needed on-chain). A priceScaled of 0 is caught at PREPARE TIME
 * (the recipe's `FAMILIES.taurusfi.gate`, mirroring every other prepare-time-
 * only gate — orca-whirlpool/raydium-clmm/manifest all work the same way),
 * so the on-chain division-by-price this ladder performs is never fed a live
 * zero by construction.
 *
 * ── Quote curve (deliberately conservative — the true depth-decay curve, if
 *    any, was not recovered) ──
 * A virtual constant-product curve is shaped so `rout` is the REAL, live
 * output-vault balance (the honest hard capacity ceiling this curve
 * asymptotes to and can never exceed — undiscounted, so the cap itself is
 * never overstated) and `rin = rout / (rate * NUM/DEN)` = `rin_true *
 * DEN/NUM` (`rin` INFLATED by the reciprocal of a 1% haircut,
 * `OUT_DISCOUNT_NUM/DEN = 99/100`), where `rate` is the haircut-free
 * validated oracle rate. Inflating `rin` (rather than shrinking `rout`, which
 * would cancel out of the small-x marginal rate `rout/rin` entirely — a
 * discount applied equally to both terms is not a discount at all at the
 * margin, only at the asymptote) means the SMALL-x marginal rate is
 * genuinely ~1% BELOW the true oracle rate — comfortably past the <=5bps of
 * noise measured above, and a much tighter, better-calibrated margin than
 * bisonfi/humidifi could achieve since neither had oracle ground truth at
 * all — while the curve still asymptotes to the REAL, undiscounted vault
 * capacity as x grows. `qTaurusFi(x, rin, rout) = mulDiv(x, rout, rin + x)`
 * — the same monotone, strictly concave shape as every other CP-style
 * fragment in this file (bisonfi/gamma/humidifi/raydium-cp-swap), so it
 * cannot trigger the "coarse ladder allocated ZERO" hazard.
 *
 * ── Account plan (14 accounts, verified against 8 independent real trades
 *    — both directions were inferred from the trailing mint-order flip;
 *    only the sell-quote (USDC->SOL) direction has a *clean* (uncorrelated
 *    to a co-occurring hop) balance-delta confirmation, but the vaults/mints/
 *    fixed accounts are IDENTICAL either way, so the reverse direction is a
 *    same-mechanism inference, not a separate guess) ──
 *   0 vault0  (writable)           — BASE mint's SPL vault (fixed per market)
 *   1 vault1  (writable)           — QUOTE mint's SPL vault (fixed per market)
 *   2 owner   (writable, signer)   — the taker's own wallet (confirmed: IS the
 *     outer transaction's fee-payer/signer on every single-hop sample)
 *   3 userAta (writable)           — taker's ATA for vault0's mint
 *   4 userAta (writable)           — taker's ATA for vault1's mint
 *   5 vaultAuthority (writable)    — PDA owning BOTH vaults (SPL "owner" field
 *     of both vault0 and vault1 — confirmed identical for both, every sample)
 *   6 (readonly)                   — venue-wide fixed account, exact role not
 *     recovered (`ECADA9SPXrZTTbWG5JJTCC7KsagYR2MLZhw2KgFhivu9`)
 *   7 priceAccount (readonly)      — the market's own oracle/state PDA
 *   8 (readonly)                   — venue-wide fixed account, exact role not
 *     recovered (`Hg2PTGCBUwRvp7S3AF5BF4tfawNshXc1N2DDWijjJndo`) — UNLIKE
 *     bisonfi's analogous 9th account, this one is NEVER a signer in any
 *     sampled swap, so there is no third-party-cosign blocker here.
 *   9 TOKEN_PROGRAM (readonly)
 *  10 TOKEN_PROGRAM (readonly, again — verified against real chain data on
 *     every sample, not a transcription artifact, same as bisonfi's 6/7)
 *  11 mintIn  (readonly)           — direction signal: this position's mint
 *  12 mintOut (readonly)           — IS the input in every real sample (the
 *     vault/ATA positions 0/1/3/4 stay FIXED regardless of direction; only
 *     this trailing pair flips)
 *  13 SysvarInstructions (readonly)
 * Instruction data (11 bytes, `patch: 'in'`): disc(1)=0x08 ++ amountIn u64 LE
 * (patched at runtime) ++ tail(2) = [0x00, 0x01] — IDENTICAL across all 7
 * clean samples (different sizes: 3,072,612 to 982,452,558; both directions;
 * times 5 minutes apart), so treated as a fixed structural constant exactly
 * like bisonfi's TAIL_FLAG.
 *
 * ── CU (venue-side CPI cost; recipe-side budget pin is out of scope for this
 *    SDK module — see the recipes' `CU_FAMILIES.taurusfi` in budget.ts) ──
 * The venue's own CPI cost is UNUSUALLY FLAT (not size-tiered, unlike
 * bisonfi): 113,624-119,290 CU across 8 samples spanning ~0.001 to ~1 SOL
 * notional, both directions.
