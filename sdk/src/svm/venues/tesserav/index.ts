/**
 * TesseraV venue adapter (program `TessVdML9pBGgG9yGks7o4HewRaXVAMuoVj4x83GLQH`)
 * — a closed-source prop-AMM. No on-chain IDL / published SDK exists, so this
 * adapter is built from a live-mainnet reverse-engineering pass (real
 * `getAccountInfo`/`getTransaction` reads, a `solana program dump`, and
 * LiteSVM replays of the deployed binary against cloned mainnet state — see
 * ./ladder.ts's header for the exact evidence and the honest exactness
 * caveat).
 *
 * ACCOUNT SHAPE (pool `FLckHLGMJy5gEoXWwcE68Nprde1D4araK4TGLw4pQq2n`, the live
 * SOL/USDC market, 1264 bytes, confirmed stable across multiple live
 * snapshots on 2026-07-31):
 *
 *   24   mintA   32B          56   mintB   32B
 *   120  lastUpdateSlot  u64 LE (matches the live cluster slot at every
 *        snapshot taken — an off-chain maker bot rewrites the ladder on a
 *        near-continuous cadence, confirmed by a separate direct top-level
 *        instruction to this program carrying an ~700-byte opaque payload and
 *        touching only 2 accounts, 408-412 CU, no logs — an oracle/ladder
 *        PUSH, not a swap)
 *   144  mid           u64 LE, scaled 1e15: `mid = round(1e15 * A_raw_per_B_raw)`
 *        — i.e. mid/1e15 is mintA-raw-units per mintB-raw-unit. Empirically
 *        matched: 1e15/mid ≈ the measured wSOL→USDC raw exchange rate to
 *        within ~0.03-0.1% across independently fetched snapshots (the
 *        residual is consistent with real price drift between fetches, not a
 *        derivation error — see ladder.ts).
 *   168  ladder A→B (sell mintA, buy mintB): 10 populated slots, stride 24:
 *          +0 price (ppm of 1e6, non-increasing across slots)
 *          +8 flag (observed constant 1 — kind/liveness marker, unmodeled)
 *          +16 cum (OUTPUT=mintB raw units for this level)
 *        then zero-padded slots (a 0-price slot terminates the walkable
 *        prefix, same convention this SDK already uses for quantum/manifest).
 *   640  ladder B→A (sell mintB, buy mintA), same 10-slot/24-byte-stride
 *        shape but fields REORDERED: +0 cum (OUTPUT=mintA raw units), +8
 *        price (ppm — numerically IDENTICAL to the A→B slot at the same
 *        index, confirmed byte-for-byte on every snapshot taken), +16 flag.
 *
 * This adapter ships ONLY the best (index-0) slot of whichever direction is
 * requested — see ladder.ts's header for why a single-slot model is the
 * correct, conservative MVP here (level-0 capacity dwarfed every size this
 * pass could test, up to 100 SOL notional, with no measurable curve
 * degradation) and the plan to extend to the full 10-slot walk.
 *
 * SWAP CPI (verified by real `sendTransaction`/`simulateTransaction` replays
 * in LiteSVM against a cloned mainnet pool, both via a real Jupiter `route`
 * CPI AND via a from-scratch native passthrough program — see ladder.ts):
 *   ix data:  tag(1B)=0x10 ++ direction(1B, 1=A→B / 0=B→A) ++
 *             amountIn(u64 LE) ++ minOut(u64 LE)
 *   accounts: [auth, pool(w), owner(signer), vaultA(w), vaultB(w),
 *              userSrcAta(w), userDstAta(w), mintA, mintB, tokenProgram,
 *              tokenProgram (again — an unused Token-2022 slot on this pool),
 *              instructionsSysvar]
 *
 * INTROSPECTION IS NOT A CALLER ALLOWLIST (measured, not assumed). Calling
 * this instruction as the transaction's OUTERMOST instruction reverts (custom
 * 0xffff / 0x5, ~34-37k CU, size-independent — an early guard). Calling it as
 * a CPI from a real Jupiter `route` succeeds; calling it as a CPI from a
 * freshly-generated, never-before-seen program id (a from-scratch native
 * passthrough, deployed nowhere) ALSO succeeds (verified: 46,908 CU, real
 * output credited). So the Instructions-sysvar read gates "must be CPI'd, not
 * top-level" only — the SAME shape as this SDK's own engine (`execute_from_
 * account` always CPIs a venue swap, never top-level) — NOT a caller
 * allowlist like Quantum's (see quantum/index.ts's own "hardcoded list of 15
 * aggregator ids" finding — a DIFFERENT, and stricter, gate that TesseraV
 * does not share). Confirm this holds on every re-verification pass; it is
 * the load-bearing fact that makes this venue buildable at all.
 *
 * NOTE — RELOCATED LADDER. This venue's merge-decomposition ladder used to sit
 * next to this file as `./ladder.ts`; it now lives in the consuming recipes
 * package, which defines every `*Ladder`, window selector and rung-feeding
 * decomposition helper itself. The SDK keeps only the generic venue
 * integration below (pool-account decode, program ids, pool-config types, and
 * the AMM/tick math the decode needs). Every `ladder.ts` reference in the text
 * above therefore points at that relocated module, not at a file in this
 * directory.
