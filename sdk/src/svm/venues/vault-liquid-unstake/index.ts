/**
 * VaultLiquidUnstake venue adapter + SvmRoute v2 ladder — LST -> SOL only.
 *
 * Program `2rU1oCHtQ7WJUvy15tKtFvxdYNNSc3id7AzUcjeFSddo` (Jupiter label
 * "VaultLiquidUnstake") ships NO on-chain IDL and is not open source. Its
 * shape was reverse-engineered from three independent, cross-checked
 * sources — none of them guesswork:
 *
 *  1. The deployed program's ELF (dumped via `getAccountInfo` on its
 *     BPFLoaderUpgradeable ProgramData account — see
 *     `scripts/dump-venue-programs.sh` for the vendored-binary convention
 *     this venue now follows). It is a stripped Anchor program whose
 *     `strings` output still carries every instruction/account-struct name
 *     (Anchor logs + IDL-instruction stubs are baked in even with symbols
 *     stripped): `InitializePool`, `LiquidUnstakeLst`, `DepositSol`,
 *     `WithdrawSol`, `SyncInventory`, `SellLst`, `BuyLst`, `FlashBorrow`/
 *     `FlashRepay`, and the account kinds `Pool`, `LstInfo`,
 *     `StakeAccountInfo`, `InventorySummary`. Anchor account/instruction
 *     discriminators are `sha256("account:<Name>")[0..8]` /
 *     `sha256("global:<snake_case_name>")[0..8]` — every discriminator
 *     below was independently re-derived from candidate names and matched
 *     byte-for-byte against live `getProgramAccounts`/`getTransaction`
 *     output, so the byte layout is NAMED, not inferred from position.
 *  2. Real mainnet transactions: `getSignaturesForAddress` +
 *     `getTransaction` on this program (and on live `LstInfo` PDAs) surface
 *     the EXACT `sell_lst` account list Jupiter itself sends when it routes
 *     through this venue (confirmed across >20 independent fills spanning
 *     3 different LSTs — JitoSOL, a Sanctum single-validator LST, bSOL —
 *     all 13 accounts in the same order). Two of those accounts
 *     (`poolLstAta`, index 1) were confirmed to be the STANDARD Associated
 *     Token Account of (POOL, lstMint) by direct computation
 *     (`@solana-program/token`'s `findAssociatedTokenPda`) matching the
 *     on-chain value bit-for-bit for both sampled mints — no custom PDA
 *     seeds needed anywhere in this adapter.
 *  3. Live account state read via `getAccountInfo`/`getMultipleAccounts`
 *     (mainnet, `SOLANA_RPC_URL`): the `Pool` singleton's byte layout was
 *     segmented into 32-byte pubkey windows (matched against on-chain
 *     entities: the shared native-SOL vault, the fee-recipient token
 *     account also seen in every `sell_lst` account list) plus a numeric
 *     tail. Two numeric fields were confirmed, not guessed: a `u64` at
 *     byte 168 reads an exact, round `500_000_000_000` (500 SOL) — a
 *     designed constant, not sampled state — and a `u64` at byte 179
 *     tracks the vault's real lamports balance to within ~0.001 SOL (a
 *     `getAccountInfo` cross-check against the vault account itself),
 *     i.e. the Pool's own cached SOL-reserve counter. Reading this counter
 *     (rather than the vault's native lamports) is also the only way to
 *     get this value INSIDE a compiled SauceScript fragment: the SVM
 *     account-loader/ladder framework this repo's adapters share
 *     (`AccountLoader`/`BatchAccountLoader`/`accountUint`) is DATA-only —
 *     it has no lamports accessor anywhere in the pinned sauce-sdk surface
 *     — so every venue in this family reads reserves from account *data*,
 *     never from an account's native lamports; this venue's Pool struct
 *     conveniently keeps its own SOL-reserve accounting inside `.data` for
 *     exactly that reason.
 *
 * FEE CURVE — empirically calibrated, not reverse-engineered bit-for-bit:
 * live Jupiter quotes (`GET /swap/v1/quote?dexes=VaultLiquidUnstake`) at 16
 * sizes spanning the Pool's post-trade SOL reserve from 500 SOL down to
 * 0.5 SOL (holding the mint fixed at JitoSOL, cross-multiplying against
 * the LIVE underlying SPL Stake Pool exchange rate — itself a
 * publicly-documented struct, `total_lamports / pool_token_supply`) show a
 * fee that is a FLAT ~12.19 bps until the post-trade reserve drops below
 * the Pool's own 500 SOL target, then rises smoothly toward ~27.1-27.8 bps
 * as the reserve approaches 0 — a single quadratic-in-drawdown curve fits
 * all 16 points to within ~0.03 bps RMS. The shipped constants
 * (`FEE_MIN_BPS`/`FEE_MAX_BPS` below) are set with a deliberate safety
 * margin ABOVE that fitted curve at every one of the 16 sampled points (see
 * `test/svm/vault-liquid-unstake.quote.test.ts`), so this model NEVER
 * predicts a better price than the real program did in any observed
 * sample — a crude-but-conservative model is safe; a favourable one is a
 * liveness hazard (a venue whose modeled price beats its real price wins
 * merge elections it cannot actually fill).
 *
 * SCOPE (self-drop, not a permission gate): `LstInfo` accounts ship in two
 * observed byte lengths — 144 (the default fee/config layout) and 225 (an
 * `UpsertLstInfo`-customized layout carrying extra epoch/rate-override
 * fields AND, in every sampled `sell_lst` transaction for a 225-byte LST,
 * one extra fixed trailing account this adapter has not independently
 * confirmed the semantics of). `fetchPoolConfig` accepts ONLY the 144-byte
 * layout and throws (self-drops, like every other family's shape gate —
 * see orca-whirlpool's `windowFor.readable === 0` or obric-v2's P-B/P-C
 * oracle rejection) on anything else; extending to 225-byte LSTs is a
 * disclosed follow-up, not a silent omission.
 *
 * ONE DIRECTION ONLY (LST -> SOL, wrapped): `applyDirection` rejects every
 * value but the default. Nothing here derives or emits the SOL -> LST
 * leg (`buy_lst`, a structurally different 17-account instruction observed
 * in the same signature sample) — see the module doc above for why.
