/**
 * ZeroFi venue adapter (program ZERor4xhbUycZ6gb9ntrhqscUcZmAbQDjEAtCf4hbZY) —
 * a closed-source, oracle-priced PMM ("prop AMM", tier P-A). No IDL, no docs:
 * every field below was recovered by dumping the deployed program (ProgramData
 * ELF, 425,485 bytes; disassembled with capstone's BPF backend), sampling real
 * mainnet `swap_v4` transactions (getTransaction, `preTokenBalances`/
 * `postTokenBalances` for the vault deltas), and cross-referencing the
 * decoded pool bytes against those deltas.
 *
 * QUOTE MODEL (measured, not assumed): the realized swap price tracks a
 * SEPARATE oracle account's live mid almost exactly, with NO detectable
 * curvature across a ~1000x input range —
 *
 *   - JUP/USDC (oracle CsyasUrpePHQAJeQHMytaTbyxEag8FCuCBiQKQvBc3GV): 7 real
 *     landed swaps, amountIn 245,414..262,787,635 (raw USDC, 6dp) all priced
 *     within 5.2156..5.2160 JUP/USDC (0.08% band, consistent with ordinary
 *     price drift across the ~15 minutes the sample spans, not size).
 *   - BONK/USDC (oracle BhDYyPxERMSyhNtVNNGN4eSqzMcBmT2ySi3FhrLXFSVs): a
 *     6-BONK dust fill cross-checked the SAME oracle-mid convention.
 *   - Fresh `simulateTransaction` re-quotes (sigVerify:false, impersonating
 *     the aggregator's own registered authority — see AUTHORITY below) at
 *     3 sizes EACH spanning ~600x (JUP/USDC: 500,000 / 25,000,000 /
 *     300,000,000 raw USDC) and ~5000x (BONK/USDC: 10,000,000 /
 *     1,000,000,000 / 50,000,000,000 raw BONK) against LIVE mainnet state
 *     reproduce a FLAT realized-price ratio to the oracle mid: 0.99872,
 *     0.99872, 0.99924 (JUP/USDC) and 0.99558, 0.99562, 0.99564 (BONK/USDC) —
 *     i.e. a per-pool, per-direction fee/spread the ladder charges as
 *     `feePpm`, ROUNDED UP from the measured value so predicted <= realized
 *     (one-sided safe for minOut, the obric-v2/solfi-v2 convention).
 *
 * The oracle (owner W1LDCARDa67SPBG7TFpQivHnEZXRtxCFP13ysEd1bWR, "Wildcard")
 * stores price as a plain IEEE-754 f64 LE at PRICE_OFFSET — verified by
 * decoding that word on two independent live feeds and matching both the
 * JUP/USDC and BONK/USDC measured ratios above to within ordinary drift.
 * ladder.ts decodes it ON-CHAIN with pure integer ops (no float unit assumed
 * in the VM): extract the exponent/mantissa by shift+mask, gate the slot to
 * 0 if the live exponent has drifted off the PREPARE-TIME baked value (the
 * fast path degenerates to a coarse staleness/sanity check — an overflow-
 * class repricing self-drops the slot rather than misquoting it), then scale
 * the 53-bit mantissa by a prepare-time-reduced (num, den) rational that
 * folds the 2^exponent term and the mintA/mintB decimals difference.
 *
 * POOL ACCOUNT LAYOUT (the `pool` fetchPoolConfig takes — 38,176 bytes,
 * owner == PROGRAM_ID; ground-truthed IDENTICALLY on both sampled pools):
 *   +72   mintA (32B)         +104  mintB (32B)
 *   +136  vaultA (32B, SPL)   +168  companionA (32B, ZeroFi-owned, 1072B)
 *   +200  vaultB (32B, SPL)   +232  companionB (32B, ZeroFi-owned, 1072B)
 *   +2184 oracle (32B, Wildcard-owned, 128B)
 * mintA/mintB/oracle are FIXED regardless of swap direction; the
 * (companion, vault) PAIR at {168,136} vs {232,200} swaps roles with
 * direction (mintA-in uses vaultA as the deposit vault; mintB-in uses
 * vaultB) — confirmed on the BONK/USDC pool in both directions.
 * `companionA`/`companionB` are ZeroFi-owned 1072-byte accounts whose fields
 * are NOT decoded by this adapter (undecoded, but real, live-owned
 * accounts — required by the CPI, not read for the quote).
 *
 * SWAP INSTRUCTION ("swap_v4", disc byte 0x10 — a single-byte opcode, not an
 * 8-byte Anchor sighash): `[0x10] ++ amountIn u64 LE ++ minOut u64 LE` (17
 * bytes). 14 accounts, order fixed regardless of direction except the
 * (companion, vault) swap noted above:
 *   0 pool  1 oracle  2 companionIn  3 vaultIn  4 companionOut  5 vaultOut
 *   6 authorityAtaB  7 authorityAtaA  8 AUTHORITY (signer)  9 tokenProgramA
 *   10 mintA  11 tokenProgramB  12 mintB  13 Sysvar Instructions
 *
 * ACCOUNTS 6/7 ("authorityAtaB"/"authorityAtaA"): decoded directly off a
 * real landed transaction AND confirmed by a controlled standalone
 * `simulateTransaction` (this adapter's ONLY instruction, no aggregator
 * wrapper, at 25,000,000 raw USDC in): both are ordinary SPL token
 * accounts (165 bytes) whose `owner` field (bytes 32..64) equals the
 * pubkey riding slot 8 exactly. THE REAL FUND FLOW, measured directly:
 * authorityAtaB (USDC) DEBITS exactly amountIn, vaultA/vaultB-side
 * CREDITS it (the pool-vault "vaultIn" in the module's earlier framing);
 * the pool's vaultOut DEBITS the realized output, authorityAtaA (JUP)
 * CREDITS exactly that amount — the authority's JUP balance in this probe
 * started at ZERO and still received the fill correctly, so slots 6/7 are
 * NOT a pre-funded capital reserve the authority must carry; they are a
 * REQUIRED, registered SIGNING/SETTLEMENT relay the swap moves value
 * through (existence + registration required, not standing inventory).
 * There is no slot anywhere in the 14 for an arbitrary, unregistered
 * caller's own token account — this is NOT a normal permissionless
 * flash-swap shape, it settles ONLY through a registered authority's own
 * accounts. One larger sampled BONK/USDC transaction moved a DIFFERENT
 * pair of accounts at these same two slots (a distinct registered
 * authority) alongside its own pool vaults, consistent with this reading:
 * whichever authority signs owns whichever pair rides slots 6/7.
 *
 * ACCOUNT 8 ("AUTHORITY", signer, not writable): validated live by flipping
 * signer-ness account-by-account against a `simulateTransaction`
 * (sigVerify:false) replay of a real historical swap — see ladder.ts's
 * module doc for the exact probe. Result: idx 8 must be a SPECIFIC
 * account (the routing aggregator's own PDA in every sampled transaction,
 * owner T1TANpTeScyeqVzzgNViGDNrkQ6qHz9KrSBS4aNXvGT in the JUP/USDC sample);
 * substituting an unrelated signer FAILS DETERMINISTICALLY (custom program
 * error 4, reproduced 3/3), while the real aggregator PDA succeeds
 * DETERMINISTICALLY (5/5). Combined with the slots-6/7-are-its-own-ATAs
 * finding above, this reads as a per-integrator registration (a real
 * market-maker/authority relationship ZeroFi's program checks), not a bare
 * "any signer" guard — an access-control + inventory gap, not a math gap.
 * `fetchPoolConfig` REFUSES (throws) a pool without a registered authority
 * rather than wiring an address guaranteed to fail on-chain — the
 * deployment must populate ZEROFI_POOL_AUTHORITY once registered with
 * ZeroFi, exactly the shape of the Quantum aggregator-whitelist gap this
 * venue set already builds past.
 *
 * FEE CATALOG: keyed by POOL (not guessed, not interpolated) — see
 * ZEROFI_POOL_FEE_PPM. A pool absent from the catalog THROWS at
 * fetchPoolConfig (refuse, don't guess — the solfi-v2 POOL_K precedent).
