/**
 * SAUCE SWEEP PROGRAM WIRE FORMAT v1 — `recipes/settle.sauce.ts` on engine target v12.
 *
 * `program := PROLOGUE || BODY`. Byte 0 is the first prologue byte — there is NO header, magic,
 * version byte, or length prefix.
 *
 * ```
 * program        := token_push{N} , TUPLE , arity , minout_push , recipient_push , body
 * token_push{N}  := N PUSHes (see wire.ts) carrying tokens REVERSED: tokens[N-1], …, tokens[0]
 * TUPLE          := 0x94              ; not a legal PUSH length (0x94 > 0x20) — the array terminator
 * arity          := one RAW byte, unsigned, MUST equal N
 * minout_push    := PUSH, uint256, value = minOut          (0 = floor disabled)
 * recipient_push := PUSH, uint160,  value = recipient      (MUST be nonzero)
 * body           := remaining bytes (must be non-empty); `keccak256(body)` is reported as
 *                    `bodyHash` for the caller to compare against, but this file pins no value
 * ```
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The prologue grammar is independent of the body, so
 * decoding tells you which `(tokens, minOut, recipient)` a program carries and nothing more. It
 * cannot exclude an appended transfer, branch, or unbounded call after the prologue — a
 * prologue-shaped program may do anything in its body.
 *
 * If you need "this is the program I audited", compile that program from source and byte-compare:
 * `@eco-incorp/sauce-sdk/recipes` ships the source and the one `baseDirs` entry, and the ordinary
 * compiler reproduces the exact bytes. That is a check against source you can read, which is
 * strictly better evidence than a hash constant shipped in the same package as the claim.
 *
 * Useful property when you do compare: the body of `recipes/settle.sauce.ts` is byte-identical for
 * every token count, every minOut and every recipient (the program is helper-free, so no jump-table
 * offsets shift with arg count) — so one body comparison covers every argument set.
 *
 * THIS decoder is CANONICAL/STRICT: unlike the recipes package's original in-repo decoder (which
 * predates this package and accepted three malformed shapes — see the `SettleFailureCode` docs
 * below), every PUSH is required to be minimal-length, token/recipient pushes are capped at 20
 * bytes, and a zero recipient is rejected. A program this decoder accepts is the UNIQUE byte
 * encoding of its `(tokens, minOut, recipient)` — which is exactly what makes §5 (re-encode and
 * compare, `encodeSettleProgram`) an equivalent, cheaper alternative to this scan.
